# Transport Facilities

**Advisory Notes**

The guidelines set out in this handbook for the various development
control parameters will generally be applied by URA in the consideration
of a development application. However, if the circumstances of a case or
the planning considerations relevant to a case so warrant, URA may in
its discretion decide to depart from these general guidelines. Persons
intending to carry out a development are advised to take this into
consideration in the conduct of their affairs and check with URA through
enquiries or development applications to confirm if their proposals can
be allowed.

The guidelines, principles and illustrations found in the handbook
series are not exhaustive in covering all possible site conditions and
building designs. In evaluating the development applications, URA
reserves the right to evaluate and impose conditions not covered in the
handbook in respond to the specific design of the development proposal
depending on merits.

**Guidelines at a Glance: Transport**

The table below is intended to provide an overview of the key guidelines
applicable for the development type. The full details of the guidelines
are stated in the relevant tabs of this handbook.

**Introduction**

Transport uses comprising bus depots, MRT depots, petrol stations, CNG
depots are zoned "Transport Facilities" in the Master Plan.

Except for petrol station developments, all other transport uses or
developments share similar planning parameters and guidelines.
Refer [[here]{.ul}](https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Transport/Petrol-Station) for
their planning parameters and guidelines of petrol stations.

### 

### Petrol Station Developments

![Guidelines for petrol stations](media/image1.jpeg)

*Guidelines for Petrol Stations*

The primary purpose of a petrol station development is for the retailing
of petrol, diesel, or other authorized fuel for use by motor vehicles. A
petrol station may accommodate supporting facilities for minor repairs,
servicing of motor vehicles, tyre repairs and limited commercial uses.
All petrol stations shall adhere to their specific development
guidelines as follows:

**Gross Plot Ratio (GPR)**

The maximum GPR is 0.5.

**Building Height**

The allowable number of storeys is 1 (maximum).

**Site Coverage**

The maximum site coverage is 50%.

**Road Buffer and Common Boundary Setback**

Petrol stations shall be set back from the road and common boundary as
indicated in the table below.

**Building Setback from Boundary**

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Type of Boundary**                **Setback Requirement**
  ----------------------------------- ----------------------------------
  From the line of Road Reserve^1^\   Minimum 7.5m\
  (All road categories)               (3m green buffer, 4.5m physical)

  From common boundary                Minimum 4.5m\
                                      (including 2m planting strip)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

^1^ **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as
required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of
Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

**Use Quantum**

Petrol stations are primarily for the retail sale of fuel. Supporting or
ancillary office use may be allowed to serve the petrol station. Limited
commercial uses such as a mini-mart may be allowed in petrol stations
for some convenience shopping to motorists. Preparation, processing and
cooking of food are not allowed. All supporting or ancillary uses in a
petrol station are subject to the following requirements:

-   Commercial spaces shall not exceed 15% of the total proposed GFA or
    > 150sqm, whichever is lower. The actual quantum allowable shall be
    > subject to planning consideration depending on the location, site
    > condition, site context, impact on the surrounding area and
    > requirements of other government agencies.

-   Ancillary offices, stores, and compressor rooms shall not exceed 10%
    > of the total proposed GFA. Mechanical repair bays may be
    > considered if the petrol station is located outside of the Water
    > Catchment Area.

**Strata Subdivision**

Strata subdivision is not allowed.

### 

### Gross Plot Ratio

The allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) is subject to evaluation, taking
into consideration the location, site context, topography, traffic
situation, impact of the Transport development on the surroundings and
other agencies' requirements.

The area of the land required to be set aside for drainage
reserve^1^ (DR) and/or road reserve^2^ (RR) to be vested in the State
may be included in the site area to compute the gross floor area (GFA)
for a GPR -- see figure below.

^1^ **Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes of
building or widening a public drain

^2^ **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as
required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of
Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

![Gross Plot Ratio for sites where vesting is required](media/image2.jpeg)

*GPR for sites where vesting is required*

### 

### Building Height

![Building height](media/image3.jpeg)

*Building Height*

Unless otherwise stated, the overall building height^1^ of transport
developments is subject to compliance with the technical height
controls of the relevant agencies such as Civil Aviation Authority of
Singapore (CAAS) and the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA).
~~These agencies require the building height to be given in m
AMSL (metres above Mean Sea Level).~~

^1^ ~~Submissions to other agencies may require the building height
based on the Singapore Height Datum (SHD). The SHD may be a positive or
negative value and it may be supplemented with a \"+\" or \"-\" sign for
clarity.~~ Building height is based on Singapore Height Datum (SHD).

### 

### Building Setback from Boundary

![Setback requirements for transport developments](media/image4.jpeg)

*Setback Requirements*

All Transport developments shall be sufficiently set back from the road
and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road
reserve^1^ line or boundary line to the external wall of the building,
excluding land to be vested to the State for road and/or drainage
purpose.

All Transport developments fronting a public road shall provide a road
buffer, the width of which depends on the hierarchy of the road. A green
buffer shall be set aside in the road buffer depending on the width of
the road buffer.

The buffer requirements for the Road Categories 1 to 5 are in Table 1
below. The common boundary setback requirements are in Table 2 below.
Different setback requirements may apply for sites within the Geylang
area or the Central Area, both of which are guided by Urban Design
guidelines.

^1^ **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as
required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of
Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

**Table 1: Road Buffer, Green Buffer**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Road Category**   **Road Buffer\
                      (inclusive of Green Buffer indicated in brackets)**

**Basements**

A basement storey refers to a storey of a building which may be
partially or wholly below the existing ground level. In so far as storey
height control is concerned, basement storeys that protrude more than
1.0m above ground level on any side shall be counted as a storey.

^1^ **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as
required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of
Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

Basements with vertical openings on the side walls may be allowed only
if they are required for natural ventilation and to meet the building
regulations. The guidelines are as follows:

-   While the protrusion measured from the level at the site boundary
    > shall not exceed 1.0m, basements may be exposed up to 2.0 m from
    > the point where the platform level meets the basement wall (ie the
    > earth around the basement wall may be cut to slope down to achieve
    > the 2.0m basement exposure with openings).

-   The extent of the slope within the green buffer or planting strip
    > shall have a gradient of 1:2.5.

-   Vertical cutting of the earth resulting in a trench around the
    > basement is not allowed.

-   The extent of the vertical openings or the types of cover over the
    > vertical openings shall be subject to the requirements of the
    > other technical departments.

-   Horizontal openings to the basement are allowed within the setback
    > distance outside the green buffer and planting strip, subject to
    > provision of effective screening to hide the view to the basement.

**Special and Detailed Control Plans ~~Control Areas~~**

Special and Detailed Control Plans (SDCP) provide detailed guidelines
for specific areas. The SDCPs may be viewed here.

**Special Control Areas**

The following areas may be subject to security requirements. URA will
confirm this upon submission of a proposed development.

![https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Others/SCA_1.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25&la=en](media/image7.jpeg)

*Special Control Area 1*

![https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Others/SCA_2.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25&la=en](media/image8.jpeg)

*Special Control Area 2*

Qualified Persons (QPs) should consider the screening requirements in
the early stage of their planning and design to avoid abortive work
subsequently.

Where security screening is deemed necessary, it shall consist of
permanent fixtures that are difficult, if not impossible to remove. The
following screening measures may be considered:

**Visual Screening**

Residential units and common areas may be screened where necessary with
blank walls, external concrete/metal fins, or the building may be
re-orientated such that the windows^1^/openings/balconies do not have
direct view towards the protected area.

^1^ **Window**: Raised openings that are at least 0.9m above the floor
slab. They are intended to provide ventilation and lighting, and not for
access. Full height windows and windows that are lower than 0.9m that
can potentially be used as access points will need to be highlighted in
the submission plans for URA's evaluation and approval.

#### **Roof Screening**

The parapet wall at the rooftop shall be at least 3m high and access to
the rooftop from a public area shall be secured by a lockable
door/hatch. The door/hatch may be electronically linked to an alarm
system monitored by the building management, if available.

application submission guidelines listed above.

**Additional Guidelines for Use of Foreshore by Developments with a
Frontage to the Sea**

For land use planning and development control purposes, the
foreshore^3^ and the area within 15m on both the landward and seaward
side of the foreshore line^4^ shall be kept free of structures. Some
structures such as ramps may be permitted if they are constructed in
connection with an approved development (eg marine industries,
refineries, and pleasure-boat storage complex). These structures are
subject to planning evaluation depending on merits.

^3^ The area between the high water mark of the Spring Tide or the top

### Ancillary Structures

Ancillary structures are minor structures erected to support the main
use of the site. The building setback distance and height control for
ancillary structures are shown in the table below.

Ancillary structures located within the green buffer may be assessed in
accordance with NPARKS\' guidelines --
see [here](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/partner-us/development-plan-submission/guidelines-on-greenery-provision-and-tree-conservation-for-developments).

Ancillary structures located within the physical buffer and building
setback that exceed the requirements in the table below, but are below
6m in height, shall be evaluated depending on the merits of the design
and function.

### 

### Parking

LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for
motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the
quantum of the gross floor area or the number of units of the
development uses.

**Car and Motor-Cycle Parking**

Under LTA's Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS), developments
are subject to car and motor-cycle^1^ parking provision requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved
plans, all car and motor-cycle parking lots shall be treated as common
property.

^1^ Motor-cycle parking provision is mandatory in all non-residential
developments.

**Range-based Car Parking Standards (RPPS)**

The RPPS allows developments to provide any level of car and motor-cycle
parking provision within a specified range, defined by a lower bound and
an upper bound -- see figure below. The range varies according to
location zones and land uses. Details may be found in [LTA's Code of
Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in
Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/vehicle-parking.html).

![Range-based Parking Provision Standards](media/image14.jpeg)

*Range-based Parking Provision Standards*

New Transport developments shall be subject to a process of waiver
evaluation by LTA, if one wishes to provide surplus car and motor-cycle
parking lots, ie parking provision above the upper bound based on the
new RPPS.

**Bicycle Parking**

To promote a car-lite society, Transport developments may be required to
provide bicycle parking facilities within the developments. Refer to
LTA's Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in
Developments [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/vehicle-parking.html) for
the list of requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved
plans, all bicycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

Bicycle parking lots provided according to LTA's new standards are
exempted from GFA computation. Surplus provision of bicycle parking lots
may be exempted from GFA computation depending on merits and context of
the development.

**Diesel and Petrol Pump Points**

Transport facilities may set up diesel and petrol pump points for own
use subject to the following:

-   The site on which the pump points shall be installed is zoned
    > Transport Facilities in the Master Plan.

-   The pump points shall be ancillary to the predominant use such as
    > vehicle depots, transport bases etc.

-   There shall be no retail of diesel and petrol to the general public
    > unless it is a designated and approved petrol kiosk or petrol
    > station.

-   Except for CNG tanks, other fuel storage tanks shall generally be
    > placed underground so that it is not visually obtrusive.

-   Relevant clearances for the pump points shall be obtained from NEA
    > and SCDF (FSSD).

**RC Flat Roofs**

RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes
only^1^. Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces and
landscaped gardens may be allowed depending on the merits of the
proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by
URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall
comply with height controls^2^ and the following guidelines.

^1 ^RC flat roofs that are accessible via ladders for maintenance
purposes only are subject to agencies' requirements for safety barriers
to ensure the safety of maintenance personnel. Safety barriers shall not
exceed 1m in height.

^2^ Height controls applicable, include:

-   Absolute technical height constraints^^ (e.g. Aviation paths
    restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).

-   Conservation guidelines (available at [URA
    SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

-   Urban design height controls (available at [URA
    SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

^^ The absolute technical height (Based on Singapore Height Datum
\[SHD\]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any of the other
height controls.

[**Solar
Panels**](https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Transport/RC-Flat-Roofs#Solar-Panels)

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if
they meet the following criteria:

a.  Solar panels are installed between 10 to 15 degrees relative to the
    horizontal plane to optimise the performance of solar panels and
    minimise glare to the buildings in the vicinity; and

b.  The installation of solar panels shall not result in the removal of
    any greenery approved under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and
    High-Rises (LUSH) Programme.

Installation of solar panels and M&E equipment such as inverters for the
solar panel system does not require planning permission except in
locations and contexts described below.

**Planning Permission**

a.  **Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation
    > Areas^1^ shall require planning permission due to their impact on
    > the roofscape.**

> ^1^ For Conservation Areas, installation of solar panels without any
> additional works are treated as localised works for the purpose of
> repair and maintenance and are considered Category 3 works for
> Conserved Buildings. Applications for such Category 3 works can be
> made by owners and contractors. Refer to the Conservation

> ^2^ A solar panel is deemed to be elevated if it is raised more than
> 1m from the roof level for landed housing developments or 1.8m from
> the roof level for other developments.

c.  **Spaces under solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial use**

> Planning permission shall be required if the spaces under elevated or
> non-elevated solar panels are enclosed or put to commercial uses such
> as Outdoor Refreshment Areas. In such instances, the spaces shall be
> computed as GFA.

**Assessment of Storey Height**

Elevated solar panels that require planning permission may be assessed
as an additional storey for storey height control purposes unless they
comply with the guidelines below:

### Earthworks, Retaining Walls, Boundary Walls

**Earthworks**

Earthworks are defined as any operations or works in, on, or over land
which result in substantial modification to the existing ground terrain,
land form, or slope. These include excavation, formation of a new slope
or embankment, and cut and fill operations.

Extensive earthworks are discouraged as it may change the existing
terrain. Earthworks may also result in the building of high retaining
walls that mar the streetscape and have adverse impacts on the
surrounding areas. Earthworks on any development site, where necessary,
shall be minimised.

Planning permission is required if earthworks involve more than 2,000sqm
of land or change in the level of the land of more than 1.5m anywhere in
the development site or relative to the neighbouring land.

The guidelines for earthworks are dependent on where the earthworks are
carried out.

![Setback and buildable area for earthworks](media/image16.jpeg)

*Location of Allowable Earthworks*

**Earthworks within the building setback area**

Earthworks may not be allowed within the building setback area, except
in the following circumstances:

-   When the proposed earthworks are to match the existing platform
    > levels of the neighbouring sites;

-   When the sites are on undulating or sloping terrain, with large
    > differences in platform levels within the site, or between the
    > site and the road;

-   When the earthcut is necessary to build a fully submerged basement.
    > The area within the building setback shall be reinstated to the
    > original platform level upon the completion of the basement.

**Earthworks within the build-able area (ie outside the building setback
area)**

Earthworks within the build-able area of more than 1m are subject to
evaluation depending on merits. If the earthfill of more than 1m is
allowed, the earthfilled area shall not be counted as an additional
storey provided the overall aggregate building height complies with the
maximum allowable building height measured from the allowable platform
level.

**Earthworks within the entire development site**

Earthfill involving the entire development site may only be considered
if the proposed earthworks are required to meet the technical
requirements of PUB. Such earthfill may be allowed up to the Minimum
Platform Level (MPL)^1^ stipulated by PUB.

^1^ **Minimum Platform Level (MPL)**: The minimum 1^st^ storey level to
be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public
Utilities Board (PUB).

[**Retaining and Boundary Walls**](https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Transport/Earthworks#Retaining-Boundary-Walls)

![Dimensions and terracing of retaining walls](media/image17.jpeg)

*Allowable Height of Retaining and Boundary Walls*

The maximum allowable height for boundary walls is 1.8m.

High retaining walls shall be avoided wherever possible, particularly
for small in-fill plots. If they have to be built and can be allowed,
they shall meet the following requirements:

-   the height shall be less than 1.5m;

-   retaining walls higher than 1.5m may be considered due to site
    > constraints and the need for extensive excavation;

-   the total visible height of the solid boundary-cum-retaining wall
    > shall not exceed 2.8m, of which the solid boundary wall shall not
    > exceed 1.8m.

If the retaining walls are to meet the MPL requirement stipulated by PUB
for drainage purposes, the retaining walls along the site boundaries
(except along boundaries that abut foreshore, roads, or waterbodies with
drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m wide) need not be tiered as
these are transitory, pending the redevelopment of the neighbouring land
to the same MPL.
