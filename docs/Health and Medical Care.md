# Health and Medical Care

**Advisory Notes**

The guidelines set out in this handbook for the various development
control parameters will generally be applied by URA in the consideration
of a development application. However, if the circumstances of a case or
the planning considerations relevant to a case so warrant, URA may in
its discretion decide to depart from these general guidelines. Persons
intending to carry out a development are advised to take this into
consideration in the conduct of their affairs and check with URA through
enquiries or development applications to confirm if their proposals can
be allowed.

The guidelines, principles and illustrations found in the handbook
series are not exhaustive in covering all possible site conditions and
building designs. In evaluating the development applications, URA
reserves the right to evaluate and impose conditions not covered in the
handbook in respond to the specific design of the development proposal
depending on merits.

**Guidelines at a Glance: Health and Medical Care**

The table below is intended to provide an overview of the key guidelines
applicable for the development type. The full details of the guidelines
are stated in the relevant tabs of this handbook.

### 

### **Introduction**

Health and Medical Care (HMC) developments include hospitals,
polyclinics and nursing homes. These are zoned HMC in the Master Plan.
All HMC developments are licensed by the Ministry of Health (MOH). For
more details on MOH's licensing requirements, see
this [link](https://elis.moh.gov.sg/elis/).

### 

### **Private Medical Clinics in Non-HMC developments**

Private medical clinics1 is an allowable use within commercial
buildings. Such buildings refer to shopping and office developments
approved on sites zoned Commercial or other commercial premises approved
within the allowable commercial quantum of sites zoned Hotel, White,
Commercial & Residential, Residential with 1st Storey Commercial,
Business Park, and Business-White.

These clinics may be allowed subject to the following conditions:

-   The total GFA for medical clinics is capped at 3,000sqm or 20% of
    > the total floor area approved for commercial use, whichever is
    > lower.

-   The 20% GFA cap does not apply to medical clinics located in
    > shophouse developments and HDB shops where the 20% quantum limit
    > would be too restrictive. The total GFA for medical clinic shall,
    > however, not exceed 3,000sqm.

Planning permission is required for new private medical clinics in
commercial buildings except in the following situations:

-   The total medical clinic GFA in the development including the
    > proposed clinic does not exceed 1,000sqm or 20% of the total
    > commercial GFA of the development, whichever is lower.

-   For shophouses and HDB shops, the total medical clinic GFA in the
    > block including the proposed clinic does not exceed 1,000sqm, and
    > HDB's prior approval has been obtained.

Operators who wish to set up medical clinics shall write to MOH
at <MOH_Check_GFAmoh.gov.sg> to verify that the proposed clinic would
qualify under the exemptions above, failing which they will need to
submit a planning application to URA. Necessary clearances and permits
from relevant licensing agencies, including MOH and Fire Safety and
Shelter Department (FSSD) shall be obtained before commencing the use.

1 SLA may assess such medical clinics/suites based on Group A
(Commercial) rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge,
where applicable.

### 

### **Sensitive Design**

The design of HMC developments shall take into consideration the
surrounding uses. For example, the building orientation and internal
floor layout shall be designed with due care and consideration to
address the amenity and privacy concerns of neighbouring developments.
Façade screenings, copious planting along the periphery boundary,
generous building setback from common boundary, high windows etc are
encouraged to blend in the HMC development with the surroundings.

### 

### **Gross Plot Ratio**

The allowable Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) is subject to evaluation, taking
into consideration the location, site context, topography, traffic
situation, impact of the HMC development on the surroundings and other
agencies' requirements.

The area of the land required to be set aside for Drainage
Reserve1 (DR) and/or Road Reserve2 (RR) to be vested in the State
may be included in the site area to compute the gross floor area (GFA)
for a GPR -- see figure below.

1 **Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes of
building or widening a public drain

2 **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as
required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of
Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

### 

**Bonus GFA Incentive Scheme**

The Bonus GFA schemes applicable to Health and Medical Care are:

**Built Environment Transformation Scheme**

The Built Environment (BE) Transformation GFA scheme aims to encourage
adoption of higher tier Construction Industry Transformation Map (ITM)
outcomes in areas of digitisation, productivity and sustainability. The
incentive scheme is jointly administered by BCA and URA. Applicants may
qualify for the scheme by adopting stipulated ITM outcomes as part of
the development proposal.

**Eligibility**

The incentive is applicable for new erection or major Addition &
Alterations to private sites of at least 5000sqm GFA[1]. Sites launched
under the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme prior to 31 March 2022
may also be eligible for the incentive scheme.

The types of developments eligible for the incentive scheme are as
follows:

  Residential[2]    Condominium and Flats development
  ------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Non- Residential   Commercial, Industrial and Institutional developments, such as office, retail, business parks, community building, hotel, hospital or white site developments
  Mixed use          Combination of the above

**Quantum of Bonus GFA Allowed**

Private sites may be granted up to 3% bonus GFA under the scheme[3].
The scheme is applicable for new proposals till 23 November 2026.

GLS sites are eligible up to 2% bonus GFA. The scheme is applicable for
new GLS launched prior to 31 March 2022.

The cumulative bonus GFA shall be kept within the overall budget of 10%
above the Master Plan Gross Plot Ratio (GPR), or the maximum allowable
GFA of the development. It shall not form the future development
potential of the site upon redevelopment.

The quantum of allowable bonus GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme is
based on the proposed uses, use quantum that complies with the Master
Plan zoning, and any additional requirements imposed as part of the
endorsement for the bonus GFA.

Should development proposals fall within areas with specific planning
considerations (e.g. storey height controls) or are unable to fully
accommodate the additional intensity due to on-site conditions (e.g.
areas with traffic concerns), the bonus GFA under the BE Transformation
Scheme that can be approved may be lower than the endorsed quantum,
and/or the bonus GFA may be limited to a particular use or uses.

**Submission Requirements**

Applicants are to submit an application to BCA with supporting documents
on the proposed ITM outcome concept plan and detail the proposed ITM
outcome to be adopted for the development proposal. The submission can
be made at this [link](https://form.gov.sg/#!/610112199bdc0c00123abb25).

Following BCA's grant of letter of acceptance, applicants shall submit
the development proposal with the proposed quantum and use group of the
proposed bonus BE Transformation GFA to URA, for detailed assessment.
The development application shall be submitted within 6 months from
BCA's grant of Letter of Acceptance, and shall include a copy of the
Letter of Acceptance, and the [BE Transformation GFA computation

*Building Height*

**Overall Building Height**

Unless otherwise stated, the overall building height1 of HMC
developments is subject to compliance with the technical height
controls of the relevant agencies such as Civil Aviation Authority of
Singapore (CAAS) and the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA).
~~These agencies require the building height to be given in m
AMSL (metres above Mean Sea Level).~~

1 ~~Submissions to other agencies may require the building height
based on the Singapore Height Datum (SHD). The SHD may be a positive or
negative value and it may be supplemented with a "+" or "-" sign for
clarity.~~ Building height is based on Singapore Height Datum (SHD).

**Floor-to-Floor Height**

The maximum floor-to-floor height of HMC developments is 5.0m.

**Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storey**

![Additional height for sky terrace floors](media/image3.jpeg){width="6.496062992125984in"


*Additional Height for Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys*

Predominant Sky Terrace Storeys (PSTS) are floors where the sky terrace
areas within the 45-degree line occupy at least 60% of the floor plate.

If the proposed number of storeys in the development is more than 7
storeys, HMC developments with PSTS may be allowed additional building
height depending on the number of storeys proposed as shown in the table
below:

**Additional Building Height based on Proposed Storey Height**

  **Proposed Storey Height of Development**   **Additional Building Height Allowed**
  ------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------
  7 - 20                                      10.0m
  21 - 30                                     15.0m
  31 - 40                                     20.0m
  41 - 50                                     25.0m
  More than 50                                30.0m

The additional building height may only be distributed to the sky
terrace floors within the development. Spaces for M&E services located
directly beneath the sky terrace floor may be included in the additional
height.

The overall building height is subject to technical height controls.

The additional building height shall not apply to:

-   Developments within Conservation Areas and sites with National
    > Monuments;

-   Developments with height control of 6 storeys or less; or

-   Developments with special controls e.g. areas with streetblock
    > plans~~/security screening areas~~.

### 

In addition to (a) -- (c), any additional building height will be
subject to evaluation for developments adjacent to conserved buildings
or in [urban design
areas](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Urban-Design) with
site-specific height considerations.

### **Building Setback from Boundary**

![Illustration of road buffer and setbacks for a Health and Medical Centre development](media/image4.jpeg){width="6.496062992125984in"


*Setback Requirements*

All HMC developments shall be sufficiently set back from the road and
common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road
reserve1 line or boundary line to the external wall of the building,
excluding land to be vested to the State for road and/or drainage
purpose.

All HMC developments fronting a public road shall provide a road buffer,
the width of which depends on the hierarchy of the road. A green buffer
shall be set aside in the road buffer depending on the width of the road
buffer.

The buffer requirements for the Road Categories 1 to 5 are in Table 1
below. The common boundary setback requirements are in Table 2 below.
Different setback requirements may apply for sites within the Central
Area, which is guided by Urban Design guidelines.

Basements with vertical openings on the side walls may be allowed only
if they are required for natural ventilation and to meet the building
regulations. The guidelines are as follows:

-   While the protrusion measured from the level at the site boundary
    > shall not exceed 1.0m, basements may be exposed up to 2.0 m from
    > the point where the platform level meets the basement wall (ie the
    > earth around the basement wall may be cut to slope down to achieve
    > the 2.0m basement exposure with openings).

-   The extent of the slope within the green buffer or planting strip
    > shall have a gradient of 1:2.5.

-   Vertical cutting of the earth resulting in a trench around the
    > basement is not allowed.

-   The extent of the vertical openings or the types of cover over the
    > vertical openings shall be subject to the requirements of the
    > other technical departments.

-   Horizontal openings to the basement are allowed within the setback
    > distance outside the green buffer and planting strip, subject to
    > provision of effective screening to hide the view to the basement.

**Special and Detailed Control Plans ~~Control Areas~~**

Special and Detailed Control Plans (SDCP) provide detailed guidelines
for specific areas. The SDCPs may be viewed here.

**Special Control Areas**

The following areas may be subject to security requirements. URA will
confirm this upon submission of a proposed development.

![https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Others/SCA_1.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25&la=en](media/image7.jpeg){width="6.496062992125984in"


*Special Control Area 1*

*Special Control Area 2*

Qualified Persons (QPs) should consider the screening requirements in
the early stage of their planning and design to avoid abortive work
subsequently.

Where security screening is deemed necessary, it shall consist of
permanent fixtures that are difficult, if not impossible to remove. The
following screening measures may be considered:

**Visual Screening**

Residential units and common areas may be screened where necessary with
blank walls, external concrete/metal fins, or the building may be
re-orientated such that the windows1/openings/balconies do not have
direct view towards the protected area.

1 **Window**: Raised openings that are at least 0.9m above the floor
slab. They are intended to provide ventilation and lighting, and not for
access. Full height windows and windows that are lower than 0.9m that
can potentially be used as access points will need to be highlighted in
the submission plans for URA's evaluation and approval.

#### **Roof Screening**

The parapet wall at the rooftop shall be at least 3m high and access to
the rooftop from a public area shall be secured by a lockable
door/hatch. The door/hatch may be electronically linked to an alarm
system monitored by the building management, if available.

For land use planning and development control purposes, the
foreshore3 and the area within 15m on both the landward and seaward
side of the foreshore line4 shall be kept free of structures. Some
structures such as ramps may be permitted if they are constructed in
connection with an approved development (eg marine industries,
refineries, and pleasure-boat storage complex). These structures are
subject to planning evaluation depending on merits.

3 The area between the high water mark of the Spring Tide or the top
of the seawall and the low water mark of the Spring Tide.

*Setback Requirements for Ancillary Structures*

Ancillary structures are minor structures erected to support the main
use of the site. The building setback distance and height control for
ancillary structures are shown in the table below.

Ancillary structures located within the green buffer may be assessed in
accordance with NPARKS' guidelines --
see [here](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/partner-us/development-plan-submission/guidelines-on-greenery-provision-and-tree-conservation-for-developments).

Ancillary structures located within the physical buffer and building
setback that exceed the requirements in the table below, but are below
6m in height, shall be evaluated depending on the merits of the design
and function.

### 

### **Parking**

LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for
motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the
quantum of the gross floor area or the number of units of the
development uses.

**Car and Motor-Cycle Parking**

Under LTA's Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS), developments
are subject to car and motor-cycle1 parking provision requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved
plans, all car and motor-cycle parking lots shall be treated as common
property.

1 Motor-cycle parking provision is mandatory in all non-residential
developments.

#### **Range-based Car Parking Standards (RPPS)**

The RPPS allows developments to provide any level of car and motor-cycle
parking provision within a specified range, defined by a lower bound and
an upper bound -- see figure below. The range varies according to
location zones and land uses. Details may be found in [LTA's Code of
Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in
Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/vehicle-parking.html).

![Range-based Parking Provision Standards](media/image15.jpeg){width="6.496062992125984in"


*Range-based Parking Provision Standards*

New HMC developments shall be subject to a process of waiver evaluation
by LTA, if one wishes to provide surplus car and motor-cycle parking
lots, ie parking provision above the upper bound based on the new RPPS.

**Bicycle Parking**

To promote a car-lite society, HMC developments may be required to
provide bicycle parking facilities within the developments. Refer to
LTA's Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in
Developments [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/vehicle-parking.html) for
the list of requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved
plans, all bicycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

Bicycle parking lots provided according to LTA's new standards are
exempted from GFA computation. Surplus provision of bicycle parking lots
may be exempted from GFA computation depending on merits and context of
the development.

### 

### **Use Quantum**

At least 60% of the total proposed GFA shall be used for HMC purposes
only. These predominant uses may include inpatient/outpatient
facilities, medical clinics/suites1, diagnostic and treatment
facilities, nursing bed areas, dispensaries, clinical research
facilities, patient-facing administration spaces, etc.

The remaining maximum 40% use quantum are for supporting or ancillary
uses like nurses' quarters, general administration and staff facilities.

1 SLA may assess such medical clinics/suites based on Group A
(Commercial) rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge,
where applicable.

**Use Quantum Control**

  **Quantum Control**   **Predominant**   **Ancillary**

                        Minimum 60%       Maximum 40%                                                
                        -                Ancillary Visitors' Hostel                                Supporting Commercial Uses
                        -                Maximum 10% of total GFA or 1,500sqm, whichever is lower   Maximum 5% of total GFA

Other supporting or ancillary uses may include Visitors' Hostel or
limited Commercial uses. Visitors' hostels are meant for family members
and companions of the patients and users of hospitals. The limited
commercial uses are meant to support the hospital operations and
functions. Their use quantum controls are as follows:

**Visitors' Hostels**

-   The hostel shall not exceed 10% of the total proposed GFA or
    > 1,500sqm, whichever is lower.

-   SLA may assess such visitors' hostels based on Group B2 (Non-landed
    > Residential) rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment
    > Charge, where applicable.

-   A Letter of Undertaking (LOU) shall be provided by the applicant,
    > declaring that the visitors' hostel shall only be occupied by the
    > family members and companions of the patients and outpatients of
    > the hospital.

**Supporting Commercial Uses**

-   Supporting commercial uses such as retail pharmacies, shops, F&B
    > outlets, food court, banks etc shall not exceed 5% of the total
    > proposed GFA. The actual commercial quantum allowable shall be
    > subject to planning consideration depending on the location, site
    > condition, site context, impact on the surrounding area and
    > requirements of other government agencies.

-   SLA may assess such supporting commercial uses based on Group A
    > (Commercial) rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment
    > Charge, where applicable.

### 

### **RC Flat Roofs**

RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes
only1. Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces and
landscaped gardens may be allowed depending on the merits of the
proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by
URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall
comply with height controls2 and the following guidelines.

1 RC flat roofs that are accessible via ladders for maintenance
purposes only are subject to agencies' requirements for safety barriers
to ensure the safety of maintenance personnel. Safety barriers shall not
exceed 1m in height.

2 Height controls applicable, include:

-   Absolute technical height constraints (e.g. Aviation paths
    restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).

-   Conservation guidelines (available at [URA
    SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

-   Urban design height controls (available at [URA
    SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

 The absolute technical height (Based on Singapore Height Datum
[SHD]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any of the other
height controls.

**Communal Pavilions**

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that
function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to communal
pavilions shall be from common areas only. The pavilions shall be
computed as GFA unless they meet the following criteria:

-   Maximum 50sqm1 or 50% of roof coverage, whichever is lower.

-   For developments which have reached the allowable storey height
    > control, the pavilions shall remain open-sided when viewed
    > externally. This is to ensure that the pavilions do not form an
    > additional storey.

-   For developments which have not reached the allowable storey height
    > or are not located within areas subject to storey height control,
    > maximum 50% perimeter enclosure of the rooftop pavilions may be
    > allowed.

-   Communal pavilions shall be integrated with lush greenery. The
    > greenery on the rooftop shall be both enjoyable by the building
    > users and visible from the surroundings.

-   Plants shall be incorporated on permanent and preferably sunken
    > planting, planned with sufficient soil depth based on the types of
    > plants proposed. Some space shall be set aside for the provision
    > of communal facilities and furniture to enhance the rooftop.

-   A Landscape Plan and relevant sections for ground/rooftop spaces
    > containing communal pavilions, showing the proposed landscaping
    > scheme, pavilion dimensions, planting palette, soil depth,
    > communal facilities, shall be submitted with the Development
    > Application.

1 The area is defined as the area of pavilion measured up to the roof
eaves line.

**Solar Panels**

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if
they meet the following criteria:

a.  Solar panels are installed between 10 to 15 degrees relative to the
    > horizontal plane to optimise the performance of solar panels and
    > minimise glare to the buildings in the vicinity; and

b.  The installation of solar panels shall not result in the removal of
    > any greenery approved under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and
    > High-Rises (LUSH) Programme.

Installation of solar panels and M&E equipment such as inverters for the
solar panel system does not require planning permission except in
locations and contexts described below.

#### **Planning Permission**

a.  **Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation
    > Areas2 shall require planning permission due to their impact on
    > the roofscape.**

> 2 For Conservation Areas, installation of solar panels without any
> additional works are treated as localised works for the purpose of
> repair and maintenance and are considered Category 3 works for
> Conserved Buildings. Applications for such Category 3 works can be
> made by owners and contractors. Refer to the Conservation
> Guidelines [here](https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/HMC/~/link.aspx?_id=6F28BA0B83114572ACA7DC1DFB84DBAC&_z=z) and

**Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH)**

LUSH is a comprehensive urban and skyrise greening programme comprising
both Landscape Replacement Areas (LRA) requirements and incentives to
provide greenery and communal spaces.

The LRA requirements are calibrated by location, GPR and development
type. A development may count Sky Terraces, Communal Planter Boxes and
Covered Communal Ground Gardens (see Greenery sub-tabs) amongst other
features, towards meeting the LRA requirement.

#### **Landscape Replacement Areas (LRA) Guidelines in Strategic Areas**

Developments in identified **Strategic Areas** shall provide LRA that is
minimally equivalent to the development's gross site area, as shown in
the table and diagram below. At least 40% of the LRA requirement shall
be reserved for softscape (permanent planting) areas. The remaining LRA
requirement may be provided as hardscape.

The Green Plot Ratio (GnPR) provides an objective measure of the density
of greenery within a site. The formula for computing GnPR and the
minimum GnPR requirement is as follows:

![Green Plot Ratio formula](media/image18.png){width="6.496062992125984in"


The Total Leaf Area shall be computed based on the Leaf Area Index (LAI)
for each plant species, canopy area (for trees and palms) and the
quantity planted. The plant species sub-categories and LAI values may be
obtained online from NParks' [Flora Fauna
Web](http://florafaunaweb.nparks.gov.sg/) by searching the common or
scientific names of plants.

The LRA requirement is not applicable to conserved buildings in historic
conservation areas. URA may exercise flexibility on LRA requirements
when evaluating individual developments affected by specific
constraints.

The table below shows the guidelines for computation of LRAs in
Strategic Areas. LRA in Strategic Areas is the sum of:

-   Horizontal surface area of the softscape eg permanent planting beds;

-   Horizontal surface area of the hardscape eg communal facilities,
    > urban farm; and

-   Vertical surface area of green walls and extensive green roofs (if
    > any).

#### **Plan Presentation Requirements for Landscape Replacement Areas**

A Landscape Plan for all Landscape Replacement Areas shall be submitted
together with the Development Application, as illustrated below.

![Example of a landscape plan](media/image19.jpeg){width="6.496062992125984in"


*Landscape Plan template (view high-res
illustration [here](https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/HMC/-/media/BB7463BC571947D1A508FD6D2C69010A.ashx))*

The plans shall include:

-   Relevant plans, cross sections and perspectives with layouts of the
    > softscape and hardscape areas. The softscape and hardscape areas
    > shall be visually differentiated on plans with the following
    > details:

    -   Computations of the overall LRA, softscape areas and Green Plot
        > Ratio;

    -   Proposed schedule and annotation of plant species and paving
        > materials;

    -   Where relevant, annotations of ancillary uses eg Swimming Pool,
        > BBQ Area, etc.;

    -   Where relevant, annotations of the 45-degree line;

    -   Short statement on the proposed maintenance and irrigation
        > methods for the planting.

Label and package the landscape plans and sections separately from the
rest of the floor plans, and separate the softscape and hardscape areas
into different layers.

URA's approval is required if there are changes to the softscape areas
(eg planting and structure of the planting beds) and hardscape areas
that result in an overall reduction in area for the required LRAs.

URA's approval is not required for changes to the planting species as
long as the softscape and Green Plot Ratio requirements are complied
with.

The following table for GnPR computation shall be filled in and
submitted together with the landscape plans.

![Example of a landscape plan](media/image19.jpeg){width="6.496062992125984in"


*Typical Landscape Plan (view high-res
illustration [here](https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/HMC/-/media/BB7463BC571947D1A508FD6D2C69010A.ashx))*

#### **Communal Planter Boxes**

Communal planter boxes shall comply with the following criteria:

-   Maximum width of 1m;

-   Maximum depth of 500mm (for planting purpose);

-   To be sufficiently externalized.

Communal planter boxes which are more than 1.0m wide may be allowed if
the wider planter boxes are part of an overall scheme with design merit.

Details of the communal planter boxes, including planting palette, spot
sections showing soil depth, and dimensions shall be provided as part of
the storey plans.

Communal planter boxes shall be designed with safety and maintainability
provisions in mind.

#### **Covered Communal Ground Gardens**

Covered Communal Ground Gardens (C2G2) are on-ground greenery spaces at
the 1st storey. The garden should flow seamlessly between the covered
and uncovered spaces of the 1st storey and designed to be bright and
airy with quality landscaping. There are two types of C2G2:

a.  Predominant C2G2s shall occupy at least 50% of the first storey
    > building footprint. Within the covered garden area, a minimum of
    > 60% shall be lushly landscaped, while the remaining 40% can be set
    > aside for meaningful communal gathering and activity spaces, and
    > unenclosed communal facilities. These spaces may include garden
    > paths, playgrounds, and covered pools. Covered drop-off points may
    > be considered as part of the C2G2 if well-integrated, paved with
    > appropriate material and integrated with lush landscaping.

b.  Secondary C2G2 are communal landscaped areas on the 1st storey
    > which are shaded by a structure or a floor or overhang above.
    > These may be exempted from GFA computation up to a maximum area
    > defined by a 45-degree line taken from the edge of the overhead
    > projection. The GFA-exempted communal areas within the 45-degree
    > line shall contain quality lush landscaping with a variety of
    > vegetation.

All areas of C2G2 spaces shall be easily accessible to the public and/or
building users during normal opening hours for the development. The
communal ground garden shall not be easily enclosed and converted to any
other uses in the future.

For GFA exemption for C2G2, refer to the [GFA
handbook](https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/HMC/~/link.aspx?_id=9E8E167B3680447CBAF72CDB36942D15&_z=z).
URA will assess the C2G2's design, spatial quality and overall
integration with the wider landscaping scheme in considering the
proposal's eligibility for GFA exemption.

A landscape plan shall be submitted as part of the Development
Application for the predominant covered ground garden proposal, showing
the proposed landscaping scheme.

#### **Communal Pavilions**

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that
function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to the
pavilions shall be from the common areas only.

In addition to being sited within lushly landscaped areas, they shall
satisfy the criteria below to qualify for GFA exemption:

more plots that staged at different time will also be required to submit
a WCP at the concept design stage.

2 LTA and URA will work with HDB on the WCP requirements.

3 Only industrial developments located within car-lite precincts or
400m of major transport nodes ie within Zone 2, will be required to
submit a WCP.

4 The five car-lite precincts are Bayshore, Jurong Lake District,
Kampong Bugis, Marina South and Woodlands North.

5 Zone 2 as defined in the Zonal Car Parking requirement in the Code
of Practice on Vehicle Parking Provision in Development proposals.
Please refer to [LTA's
website](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/vehicle-parking.html) for
more details.

[**Design of
WCP**](https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/HMC/WCP#Design)

The WCP shall consider the safety, convenience, and accessibility of
pedestrians and cyclists, and incorporate the following elements in the
design of the development:

-   Provision of convenient and direct access from nearby public
    > transport facilities and adjacent developments;

-   Provision of measures to minimise conflicts between pedestrians,
    > cyclists and motor vehicles at locations such as the vehicular
    > ingress/egress, car park entrances, and drop-off points;

-   Provision of sufficient and conveniently located bicycle parking
    > spaces and supporting amenities such as shower facilities and
    > lockers;

-   Provision of way-finding signage to public transport facilities and
    > amenities for cyclists; and

-   Provision of barrier-free access and routes for children, elderly
    > and the mobility challenged groups.

The detailed guidelines on WCP and submission requirements are
summarised in LTA's Code of Practice[ "Street Work Proposals Relating to
Development
Works"](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/street-proposals.html).

To provide assistance on developing active mobility-related
infrastructure in a holistic manner, a Walking & Cycling Design Guide
has been produced as a supplement to the respective agencies' prevailing
COPs, engineering and development standards. The Guide can be
downloaded [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/walk-cycle-ride/WCP.html).

### **Earthworks, Retaining Walls, Boundary Walls**

**Earthworks**

Earthworks are defined as any operations or works in, on, or over land
which result in substantial modification to the existing ground terrain,
land form, or slope. These include excavation, formation of a new slope
or embankment, and cut and fill operations.

Extensive earthworks are discouraged as it may change the existing
terrain. Earthworks may also result in the building of high retaining
walls that mar the streetscape and have adverse impacts on the
surrounding areas. Earthworks on any development site, where necessary,
shall be minimised.

Planning permission is required if earthworks involve more than 2,000sqm
of land or change in the level of the land of more than 1.5m anywhere in
the development site or relative to the neighbouring land.

The guidelines for earthworks are dependent on where the earthworks are
carried out.

![Setback and buildable area for earthworks](media/image21.jpeg){width="6.496062992125984in"


*Location of Allowable Earthworks*

**Earthworks within the building setback area**

Earthworks may not be allowed within the building setback area, except
in the following circumstances:

-   When the proposed earthworks are to match the existing platform
    > levels of the neighbouring sites;

-   When the sites are on undulating or sloping terrain, with large
    > differences in platform levels within the site, or between the
    > site and the road;

-   When the earthcut is necessary to build a fully submerged basement.
    > The area within the building setback shall be reinstated to the
    > original platform level upon the completion of the basement.

**Earthworks within the build-able area (ie outside the building setback
area)**

Earthworks within the build-able area of more than 1m are subject to
evaluation depending on merits. If the earthfill of more than 1m is
allowed, the earthfilled area shall not be counted as an additional
storey provided the overall aggregate building height complies with the
maximum allowable building height measured from the allowable platform
level.

**Earthworks within the entire development site**

Earthfill involving the entire development site may only be considered
if the proposed earthworks are required to meet the technical
requirements of PUB. Such earthfill may be allowed up to the Minimum
Platform Level (MPL)1 stipulated by PUB.

1 **Minimum Platform Level (MPL)**: The minimum 1st storey level to
be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public
Utilities Board (PUB).

**Retaining & Boundary Walls**

![Dimensions and terracing of retaining walls](media/image22.jpeg){width="6.496062992125984in"


*Allowable Height of Retaining and Boundary Walls*

The maximum allowable height for boundary walls is 1.8m.

High retaining walls shall be avoided wherever possible, particularly
for small in-fill plots. If they have to be built and can be allowed,
they shall meet the following requirements:

-   the height shall be less than 1.5m;

-   retaining walls higher than 1.5m may be considered due to site
    > constraints and the need for extensive excavation;

-   the total visible height of the solid boundary-cum-retaining wall
    > shall not exceed 2.8m, of which the solid boundary wall shall not
    > exceed 1.8m.

If the retaining walls are to meet the MPL requirement stipulated by PUB
for drainage purposes, the retaining walls along the site boundaries
(except along boundaries that abut foreshore, roads, or waterbodies with
drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m wide) need not be tiered as
these are transitory, pending the redevelopment of the neighbouring land
to the same MPL.

[1]: Smaller developments of less than 5,000 sqm GFA may be considered
    on a case-by-case basis if agencies determine that sizeable
    productivity and sustainability outcomes relative to the development
    proposal can be achieved based on BE ITM measures proposed by the
    developers.

[2]: The maximum allowable number of dwelling units for residential
    developments located outside of Central Area is derived from the
    Master Plan permissible intensity, which excludes any bonus GFA the
    site is eligible for.

[3]: Applications submitted under the Strategic Development Incentive
    (SDI) and Central Business District (CBD) incentive schemes will
    have to comply with stipulated outcomes in the areas of
    digitalisation, productivity and sustainability. The required ITM
    outcomes will be separately assessed in relation to the context of
    the proposal, upon submission of the outline application for the
    SDI/CBDI development proposal. ITM outcomes will be imposed as
    conditions for planning approval for redevelopment proposals via the
    SDI/CBD Incentive scheme. SDI/CBDI proposals will not qualify for
    the additional GFA under the BE Transformation Gross Floor Area
    Incentive Scheme.
