# Business 2

### **Advisory Notes**

The guidelines set out in this handbook for the various development
control parameters will generally be applied by URA in the consideration
of a development application. However, if the circumstances of a case or
the planning considerations relevant to a case so warrant, URA may in
its discretion decide to depart from these general guidelines. Persons
intending to carry out a development are advised to take this into
consideration in the conduct of their affairs and check with URA through
enquiries or development applications to confirm if their proposals can
be allowed.

The guidelines, principles and illustrations found in the handbook
series are not exhaustive in covering all possible site conditions and
building designs. In evaluating the development applications, URA
reserves the right to evaluate and impose conditions not covered in the
handbook in respond to the specific design of the development proposal
depending on merits.

**Guidelines at a Glance: Business 2 (Industrial)**

The table below is intended to provide an overview of the key guidelines
applicable for the development type. The full details of the guidelines
are stated in the relevant tabs of this handbook.

### 

### **Introduction**

Industrial developments comprise factories, warehouses,
telecommunication and utility buildings. These developments may be
allowed on land zoned Business 1 (B1) or Business 2 (B2).

Depending on the nature of their activities, clean and light industries
are allowed in Business 1 (B1) zone. General and special industries are
to be located in Business 2 (B2) zone.

The National Environment Agency (NEA) would require a 100m nuisance
buffer from a B2 zone to the surrounding area. The allowable types of
industry or use within industrial developments in B2 zone, based on
NEA's nuisance buffer requirements, are
listed [here](https://e-services.nea.gov.sg/ias/PublicApplicant/Homepage.aspx).

### 

### **Gross Plot Ratio**

The Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) of a B2 development is guided by the GPR
specified in the Master Plan (MP). This upper bound GPR may not always
be achievable because of site limitations like plot size, shape of the
plot, site topography or ground conditions, building setbacks, building
height or technical requirements of other authorities that may affect
the site.

The area of the land required to be set aside for Drainage
Reserve^1^ (DR) and/or Road Reserve^2^ (RR) to be vested in the State
may be included in the site area to compute the gross floor area (GFA)
for a GPR -- see figure below.

^1^ **Drainage Reserve**: An area safeguarded for purposes of building
or widening a public drain.

^2^ **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as
required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of
Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

*GPR for sites where vesting is required*

B2-White

B2 sites located next to MRT stations may be zoned B2-W. The white
component is to provide flexibility for industrial companies in such
locations to accommodate synergistic White uses.

For such B2-W sites, a minimum GPR shall be achieved for the permissible
B2 uses first. This minimum GPR for B2 uses is indicated in the square
brackets on the Master Plan.

For example, in the map below, the site next to Joo Koon MRT Station is
zoned "**2.5 \[B-2.0\] W**". A B2-W site would have an overall allowable
GPR of 2.5. A minimum GPR of 2.0 must be achieved and used for
industrial purposes before the remaining GPR 0.5 may be unlocked for
White uses.

Refer to the section on [Allowable
Uses](https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/~/link.aspx?_id=8800A2428CEB4E0DA4BEF750EA557AAD&_z=z) for
the list of allowable uses within the White component.

**Bonus GFA Incentive Schemes**

The Bonus GFA schemes applicable to Business 2 are:

**Built Environment Transformation Scheme**

The Built Environment (BE) Transformation GFA scheme aims to encourage
adoption of higher tier Construction Industry Transformation Map (ITM)
outcomes in areas of digitisation, productivity and sustainability. The
incentive scheme is jointly administered by BCA and URA. Applicants may
qualify for the scheme by adopting stipulated ITM outcomes as part of
the development proposal.

**Eligibility**

The incentive is applicable for new erection or major Addition &
Alterations to private sites of at least 5000sqm GFA[^1]. Sites launched
under the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme prior to 31 March 2022
may also be eligible for the incentive scheme.

The types of developments eligible for the incentive scheme are as
follows:

  Residential[^2]    Condominium and Flats development
  ------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Non- Residential   Commercial, Industrial and Institutional developments, such as office, retail, business parks, community building, hotel, hospital or white site developments
  Mixed use          Combination of the above

**Quantum of Bonus GFA Allowed**

Private sites may be granted up to 3% bonus GFA under the scheme[^3].
The scheme is applicable for new proposals till 23 November 2026.

GLS sites are eligible up to 2% bonus GFA. The scheme is applicable for
new GLS launched prior to 31 March 2022.

The cumulative bonus GFA shall be kept within the overall budget of 10%
above the Master Plan Gross Plot Ratio (GPR), or the maximum allowable
GFA of the development. It shall not form the future development
potential of the site upon redevelopment.

The quantum of allowable bonus GFA under the BE Transformation Scheme is
based on the proposed uses, use quantum that complies with the Master
Plan zoning, and any additional requirements imposed as part of the
endorsement for the bonus GFA.

Should development proposals fall within areas with specific planning
considerations (e.g. storey height controls) or are unable to fully
accommodate the additional intensity due to on-site conditions (e.g.
areas with traffic concerns), the bonus GFA under the BE Transformation
Scheme that can be approved may be lower than the endorsed quantum,
and/or the bonus GFA may be limited to a particular use or uses.

**Submission Requirements**

Applicants are to submit an application to BCA with supporting documents
on the proposed ITM outcome concept plan and detail the proposed ITM
outcome to be adopted for the development proposal. The submission can
be made at this [link](https://form.gov.sg/#!/610112199bdc0c00123abb25).

Following BCA's grant of letter of acceptance, applicants shall submit

*Setback Requirements*

All industrial developments shall be sufficiently set back from the road
and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road
reserve^1^ line or boundary line to the external wall of the building,
excluding land to be vested to the State for road and/or drainage
purpose.

All industrial developments fronting a public road shall provide a road
buffer, the width of which depends on the hierarchy of the road. A green
buffer shall be set aside in the road buffer depending on the width of
the road buffer.

The buffer requirements for the Road Categories 1 to 5 are in Table 1
below. The common boundary setback requirements are in Table 2 below.

^1^ **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as
required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of
Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

height="4.166521216097988in"}

*Building Height*

**Overall Building Height**

Unless otherwise stated, the overall building height^1^ of industrial
developments is subject to compliance with the technical height
controls of the relevant agencies such as Civil Aviation Authority of
Singapore (CAAS) and the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA).
~~These agencies require the building height to be given in m
AMSL (metres above Mean Sea Level).~~

^1^ ~~Submissions to other agencies may require the building height
based on the Singapore Height Datum (SHD). The SHD may be a positive or
negative value and it may be supplemented with a \"+\" or \"-\" sign for
clarity.~~ Building height is based on Singapore Height Datum (SHD).

**Floor-to-Floor Height**

The minimum floor-to-floor height of industrial buildings is 4.0m.

### 

### **Basements**

A basement storey refers to a storey of a building which may be
partially or wholly below the existing ground level. In so far as storey
height control is concerned, basement storeys that protrude more than
1.0m above ground level on any side shall be counted as a storey.

^1^ **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as
required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of
Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

Basements with vertical openings on the side walls may be allowed only
if they are required for natural ventilation and to meet the building
regulations. The guidelines are as follows:

-   While the protrusion measured from the level at the site boundary
    > shall not exceed 1.0m, basements may be exposed up to 2.0 m from
    > the point where the platform level meets the basement wall (ie the
    > earth around the basement wall may be cut to slope down to achieve
    > the 2.0m basement exposure with openings).

-   The extent of the slope within the green buffer or planting strip
    > shall have a gradient of 1:2.5.

-   Vertical cutting of the earth resulting in a trench around the
    > basement is not allowed.

-   The extent of the vertical openings or the types of cover over the
    > vertical openings shall be subject to the requirements of the
    > other technical departments.

-   Horizontal openings to the basement are allowed within the setback
    > distance outside the green buffer and planting strip, subject to
    > provision of effective screening to hide the view to the basement.

*Basement Horizontal Openings*

### 

**Special and Detailed Control Plans**

Special and Detailed Control Plans (SDCP) provide detailed guidelines
for specific areas. The SDCPs may be viewed here.

**Special Control Areas**

The following areas may be subject to security requirements. URA will
confirm this upon submission of a proposed development.

![https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Others/SCA_1.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25&la=en](media/image7.jpeg){width="6.496062992125984in"
height="3.606201881014873in"}

*Special Control Area 1*

![https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Others/SCA_2.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25&la=en](media/image8.jpeg){width="6.496062992125984in"
height="3.3150820209973753in"}

*Special Control Area 2*

Qualified Persons (QPs) should consider the screening requirements in
the early stage of their planning and design to avoid abortive work
subsequently.

Where security screening is deemed necessary, it shall consist of
permanent fixtures that are difficult, if not impossible to remove. The
following screening measures may be considered:

**Visual Screening**

Residential units and common areas may be screened where necessary with
blank walls, external concrete/metal fins, or the building may be
re-orientated such that the windows^1^/openings/balconies do not have
direct view towards the protected area.

^1^ **Window**: Raised openings that are at least 0.9m above the floor
slab. They are intended to provide ventilation and lighting, and not for
access. Full height windows and windows that are lower than 0.9m that
can potentially be used as access points will need to be highlighted in
the submission plans for URA's evaluation and approval.

#### **Roof Screening**

The parapet wall at the rooftop shall be at least 3m high and access to
the rooftop from a public area shall be secured by a lockable
door/hatch. The door/hatch may be electronically linked to an alarm
system monitored by the building management, if available.**\
**

### **Developments Involving Waterbodies**

To maintain the integrity and aesthetics of the waterfront areas so that
the public can have free and unrestricted access to enjoy these spaces,
developments at major waterbodies^1^ shall observe the design and
development application submission guidelines below.

^1^ Major waterbodies: rivers, canals of at least 17.5m width,
reservoirs, and seas.

![Design guidelines apply to all developments adjacent to waterbodies or rivers and canals with drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m](media/image9.jpeg){width="6.496062992125984in"

*Developments at Major Waterbodies*

**Design Guidelines**

1.  **Retaining Walls**

> Retaining walls along the waterbodies may be allowed subject to the
> following criteria:

a.  Retaining walls are less than 1.5m in height;

b.  Retaining walls are set back at least 300mm from the boundary;

c.  Retaining walls are covered with creepers.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2.  **Boundary Walls/Fences**

> For non-industrial developments, proposed boundary fences shall be
> porous (eg chained-link, metal-grille, or timber fence). 
>
> For industrial developments, the following may be allowed:

a.  Solid boundary walls not exceeding 1.8m in height. The walls shall
    > be aesthetically treated.

b.  Chain-linked fences not exceeding 1.8m in height with close planting
    > of shrubs/vegetation as screenings. A planting strip of 0.5m width
    > (minimum) shall be provided within the development.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.  **Slope**

> There shall be no abrupt change in slope gradient at the boundary
> between the development and the waterbody. The slope gradient shall
> not exceed 1:2.

4.  **Conservation of Vegetation**

> Mature vegetation along the waterbodies are to be saved and conserved,
> wherever possible.

**Development Application Submission Guidelines**

In all waterbodies-related development application submissions to URA,
the following shall be provided, where applicable:

-   Site/Location Plan showing the width and alignment of Drainage
    > Reserve^2^/Waterbody/Coastal Profile;

-   Layout plans and cross-sections showing the area between the site
    > and the Drainage Reserve/Waterbody/Coastal Area including existing
    > and proposed ground levels;

-   Design details of integration with waterbody including slope,
    > retaining wall, and boundary wall/fencing (Height, Type,
    > Screening);

-   Contour lines extending to 1m beyond the side of development
    > fronting the Drainage Reserve/Waterbody/Sea;

    > Waterbodies-related proposals.

^2^ **Drainage Reserve (DR)**: An area safeguarded for purposes of
building or widening a public drain

**Application of Guidelines**

The design guidelines listed above shall apply to all developments
adjacent to or with waterbodies except developments adjacent to or with
Drainage Reserves less than 17.5m.

All proposals involving waterbodies shall comply with the development
application submission guidelines listed above.

#### **Additional Guidelines for Use of Foreshore by Developments with a Frontage to the Sea**

For land use planning and development control purposes, the
foreshore^3^ and the area within 15m on both the landward and seaward
side of the foreshore line^4^ shall be kept free of structures. Some
structures such as ramps may be permitted if they are constructed in
connection with an approved development (eg marine industries,
refineries, and pleasure-boat storage complex). These structures are
subject to planning evaluation depending on merits.

^3^ The area between the high water mark of the Spring Tide or the top
of the seawall and the low water mark of the Spring Tide.

![The foreshore line as defined by the high water mark of the Spring Tide](media/image11.jpeg)

![The foreshore line as defined by the top of the existing sea wall](media/image12.jpeg)

^4^ The high water mark of the Spring Tide; the top of the existing
seawall or revertment or river wall (where appropriate) for controlling
landward development.

*Setback Requirements for Ancillary Structures*

Ancillary structures are minor structures erected to support the main
use of the site. The building setback distance and height control for
ancillary structures are shown in the table below.

Ancillary structures located within the green buffer may be assessed in
accordance with NPARKS\' guidelines --
see [here](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/partner-us/development-plan-submission/guidelines-on-greenery-provision-and-tree-conservation-for-developments).

Ancillary structures located within the physical buffer and building
setback that exceed the requirements in the table below, but are below
6m in height, shall be evaluated depending on the merits of the design
and function.

### 

### **Parking**

LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for
motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the
quantum of the gross floor area or the number of units of the
development uses.

**Car and Motor-Cycle Parking**

Under LTA's Range-based Parking Provision Standards (RPPS), developments
are subject to car and motor-cycle^1^ parking provision requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved
plans, all car and motor-cycle parking lots shall be treated as common
property.

^1^ Motor-cycle parking provision is mandatory in all non-residential
developments.

#### **Range-based Car Parking Standards (RPPS)**

The RPPS allows developments to provide any level of car and motor-cycle
parking provision within a specified range, defined by a lower bound and
an upper bound -- see figure below. The range varies according to
location zones and land uses. Details may be found in [LTA's Code of
Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in
Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/vehicle-parking.html).

![Range-based Parking Provision Standards](media/image15.jpeg)

*Range-based Parking Provision Standards*

New B2 developments shall be subject to a process of waiver evaluation
by LTA, if one wishes to provide surplus car and motor-cycle parking
lots, ie parking provision above the upper bound based on the new RPPS.

#### **Private Parking Lots**

Within multi-user developments, industrial [strata units]{.ul} may be
allowed to have their own private car/lorry parking lots subject to the
following:

-   The private parking lots are surplus parking lots over and above
    > LTA's minimum parking provision;

-   The floor area of the private parking lots shall be computed as GFA
    > under the 40% ancillary quantum of each strata-unit;

-   The private parking lots are physically contiguous to the industrial
    > strata unit.

For approved private car/lorry parking areas that were previously not
computed as GFA, they may be converted to other allowable useable area
subject to the following:

-   These areas are computed as GFA and the resultant GFA does not
    > exceed the current MP GPR Control for the development site;

-   The proposed conversion is authorised by the MCST via a 90%
    > resolution;

-   The remaining number of parking lots after conversion still meet
    > LTA's minimum parking provision;

-   SLA may levy Land Betterment Charge, where applicable.

**Bicycle Parking**

To promote a car-lite society, B2 developments may be required to
provide bicycle parking facilities within the developments. Refer to
LTA's Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking Provision in
Developments [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/vehicle-parking.html) for
the list of requirements.

Unless explicitly approved as private parking lots in the approved
plans, all bicycle parking lots shall be treated as common property.

Bicycle parking lots provided according to LTA's new standards are
exempted from GFA computation. Surplus provision of bicycle parking lots
may be exempted from GFA computation depending on merits and context of
the development.

### **Minimum Unit Size**

![https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Industrial/B104_Minimum_Unit_Size.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25&la=en](media/image16.jpeg){width="6.496062992125984in"
height="4.168707349081365in"}

*Minimum Unit Size*

The minimum size of an industrial unit is 150sqm. This is deemed a
meaningful space to meet the operational needs of industrial uses.

### 

### **Use Quantum**

At least 60% of the total B2 industrial GFA (ie minimum 60%) shall be
used for industrial purpose^1^. The remaining 40% may be used for
ancillary (or supporting) uses. Tables 1 and 2 below shows the
applicable use quantum control for a single-user or multi-user
industrial development respectively.

^1^ This is also applicable to to B2-White sites.

**Table 1: Single-User Development**

![https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/-/media/ECD8FB01D9B4415CB3349EFD86D82F8E.ashx?h=100%25&w=100%25](media/image17.jpeg)

*Single-User Use Quantum*

**Table 1: Single User Development**

  **Predominant**   **Ancillary**
  ----------------- ---------------
  Minimum 60%       Maximum 40%

***Note**: For single-user developments, strata subdivision is not
allowed. Sub-leasing of space is allowed.*

Single-user/owner developments (i.e. not strata subdivided) that
sub-lease space to other tenants are subject to the same quantum
controls as multi-user developments (see Table 2 below).

**Table 2: Multi-User Development**

![https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/-/media/3A5A60B5C2D845DF961155726FE3116A.ashx?h=100%25&w=100%25](media/image18.jpeg)

*Use Quantum within each Strata Unit*

**Table 2: Multi-User Development**

  **Predominant**                   **Ancillary**
  --------------------------------- ---------------
  **Entire Development**            
  Minimum 60%                       Maximum 40%
  **Each Strata-subdivided Unit**   
  Minimum 60%                       Maximum 40%

### 

Up to 40% of the floor area of the development is for ancillary quantum
at the development level, which comprises all common areas outside the
units (such as common corridors, staircases, lifts, toilets, M&E spaces)
and all secondary uses (see the *'Guidelines for Allowable
Uses'* section [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/Allowable-Uses)).

Within each strata-subdivided industrial unit, at least 60% of the floor
area shall be used for industrial uses. Ancillary uses (e.g. ancillary
office, meeting rooms) shall not occupy more than 40% of the unit's
floor area.

### **Allowable Uses**

Examples of allowable uses on B2 sites under the predominant and
ancillary (or supporting) use categories are shown below. Uses not
indicated below shall be evaluated on the merits of the case.

may be contained in separate buildings provided that there is no land
subdivision.

### **Guidelines for Allowable Uses**

**Guidelines on Showroom**

Showroom in industrial premises are meant primarily for the display of
two categories of products as follows:

-   Products that are not typically transacted or exchanged over the
    > counter (eg bulky items such as furniture, motor vehicle).

-   Products that are predominantly delivered and installed off-site (eg
    > floor tiles)

Incidental sales of small items or "cash-and-carry" products may be
considered only if the main activity of the showroom is for display of
the two categories of products listed above.

Showroom proposals will only be considered as part of a Change of Use
application, after the building has obtained a Temporary Occupation
Permit (TOP) and when the prospective end-user or business operator for
the showroom space is known.

Showroom may be considered subject to the following:

-   Showroom shall be confined to the 1^st^ storey of the development.

-   SLA may assess such showrooms based on Group A Commercial rate for
    > the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

**Guidelines on Ancillary Display Area**

An ancillary display area is meant only for the display of products
related to the predominant industrial operations in the development.

Ancillary display area may be considered subject to the following
conditions:

-   Displayed products are purely for corporate or demonstration
    > purposes that serve corporate customers of the industrial
    > companies only and not open to public;

-   These products cannot be sold on-the-premises or on site;

-   There shall be no strata-subdivision or sub-leasing of these areas;
    > and

-   Endorsement from relevant agencies (eg HDB & JTC for leased
    > premises; EDB & ESGfor private premises) may be required.

SLA may assess such ancillary display areas based on Group D Industrial
rate for the purpose of computing Land Betterment Charge.

#### **Conversion of Previously-Approved Ancillary Showroom**

If an existing industrial development has a previously approved
ancillary showroom (now re-termed Display Area), the owner or operator
of such ancillary showroom may apply for planning permission to convert
it to a showroom in accordance with the showroom definition and
guideline stated above.

Alternatively, the previously approved ancillary showroom may be
expanded to function as an enlarged ancillary display area in accordance
with the current definition for ancillary display area and guideline
stated above.

The table below shows what can or cannot be done to a previously
approved ancillary showroom.

### **RC Flat Roofs**

RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes
only^1^. Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces and
landscaped gardens may be allowed depending on the merits of the
proposal. No structures shall be allowed unless otherwise approved by
URA. Where allowed, structures (including any safety barriers) shall
comply with height controls^2^ and the following guidelines.

^1 ^RC flat roofs that are accessible via ladders for maintenance
purposes only are subject to agencies' requirements for safety barriers
to ensure the safety of maintenance personnel. Safety barriers shall not
exceed 1m in height.

^2^ Height controls applicable, include:

-   Absolute technical height constraints^@^ (e.g. Aviation paths
    restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).

-   Conservation guidelines (available at [URA
    SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

-   Urban design height controls (available at [URA
    SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

^@^ The absolute technical height (Based on Singapore Height Datum
\[SHD\]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any of the other
height controls.

**Communal Pavilions**

Communal pavilions are small-scale, ancillary landscaping features that
function as sheltered, open-sided resting points. Access to communal
pavilions shall be from common areas only. The pavilions shall be
computed as GFA unless they meet the following criteria:

-   Maximum 50sqm^1^ or 50% of roof coverage, whichever is lower.

-   For developments which have reached the allowable storey height
    > control, the pavilions shall remain open-sided when viewed
    > externally. This is to ensure that the pavilions do not form an
    > additional storey.

-   For developments which have not reached the allowable storey height
    > or are not located within areas subject to storey height control,
    > maximum 50% perimeter enclosure of the rooftop pavilions may be
    > allowed.

-   Communal pavilions shall be integrated with lush greenery. The
    > greenery on the rooftop shall be both enjoyable by the building
    > users and visible from the surroundings.

-   Plants shall be incorporated on permanent and preferably sunken
    > planting, planned with sufficient soil depth based on the types of
    > plants proposed. Some space shall be set aside for the provision
    > of communal facilities and furniture to enhance the rooftop.

-   A Landscape Plan and relevant sections for ground/rooftop spaces
    > containing communal pavilions, showing the proposed landscaping
    > scheme, pavilion dimensions, planting palette, soil depth,
    > communal facilities, shall be submitted with the Development
    > Application.

^1^ The area is defined as the area of pavilion measured up to the roof
eaves line.

**Solar Panels**

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if
they meet the following criteria:

a.  Solar panels are installed between 10 to 15 degrees relative to the
    > horizontal plane to optimise the performance of solar panels and
    > minimise glare to the buildings in the vicinity; and

b.  The installation of solar panels shall not result in the removal of
    > any greenery approved under the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and
    > High-Rises (LUSH) Programme.

Installation of solar panels and M&E equipment such as inverters for the
solar panel system does not require planning permission except in
locations and contexts described below.

#### **Planning Permission**

a.  **Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation
    > Areas^2^ shall require planning permission due to their impact on
    > the roofscape.**

> ^2^ For Conservation Areas, installation of solar panels without any
> additional works are treated as localised works for the purpose of
> repair and maintenance and are considered Category 3 works for
> Conserved Buildings. Applications for such Category 3 works can be
> made by owners and contractors. Refer to the Conservation
> Guidelines [here](https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/B2/~/link.aspx?_id=6F28BA0B83114572ACA7DC1DFB84DBAC&_z=z) and

*Submission Flowchart*

^1^ Developments that have a master developer, and consist of two or
more plots that staged at different time will also be required to submit
a WCP at the concept design stage.

^2^ LTA and URA will work with HDB on the WCP requirements.

^3^ Only industrial developments located within car-lite precincts or
400m of major transport nodes ie within Zone 2, will be required to
submit a WCP.

^4^ The five car-lite precincts are Bayshore, Jurong Lake District,
Kampong Bugis, Marina South and Woodlands North.

^5^ Zone 2 as defined in the Zonal Car Parking requirement in the Code
of Practice on Vehicle Parking Provision in Development proposals.
Please refer to [LTA\'s
website](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/vehicle-parking.html) for
more details.

**Design of WCP**

The WCP shall consider the safety, convenience, and accessibility of
pedestrians and cyclists, and incorporate the following elements in the
design of the development:

-   Provision of convenient and direct access from nearby public
    > transport facilities and adjacent developments;

-   Provision of measures to minimise conflicts between pedestrians,
    > cyclists and motor vehicles at locations such as the vehicular
    > ingress/egress, car park entrances, and drop-off points;

-   Provision of sufficient and conveniently located bicycle parking
    > spaces and supporting amenities such as shower facilities and
    > lockers;

-   Provision of way-finding signage to public transport facilities and
    > amenities for cyclists; and

-   Provision of barrier-free access and routes for children, elderly
    > and the mobility challenged groups.

The detailed guidelines on WCP and submission requirements are
summarised in LTA's Code of Practice[ "Street Work Proposals Relating to
Development
Works"](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/street-proposals.html).

To provide assistance on developing active mobility-related
infrastructure in a holistic manner, a Walking & Cycling Design Guide
has been produced as a supplement to the respective agencies' prevailing
COPs, engineering and development standards. The Guide can be
downloaded [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/walk-cycle-ride/WCP.html).

### **Earthworks, Retaining Walls, and Boundary Walls**

**Earthworks**

Earthworks are defined as any operations or works in, on, or over land
which result in substantial modification to the existing ground terrain,
land form, or slope. These include excavation, formation of a new slope
or embankment, and cut and fill operations.

Extensive earthworks are discouraged as it may change the existing
terrain. Earthworks may also result in the building of high retaining
walls that mar the streetscape and have adverse impacts on the
surrounding areas. Earthworks on any development site, where necessary,
shall be minimised.

Planning permission is required if earthworks involve more than 2,000sqm
of land or change in the level of the land of more than 1.5m anywhere in
the development site or relative to the neighbouring land.

The guidelines for earthworks are dependent on where the earthworks are
carried out.

![Setback and buildable area for earthworks](media/image22.jpeg)

*Location of Allowable Earthworks*

#### **Earthworks within the building setback area**

Earthworks may not be allowed within the building setback area, except
in the following circumstances:

-   When the proposed earthworks are to match the existing platform
    > levels of the neighbouring sites;

-   When the sites are on undulating or sloping terrain, with large
    > differences in platform levels within the site, or between the
    > site and the road;

-   When the earthcut is necessary to build a fully submerged basement.
    > The area within the building setback shall be reinstated to the
    > original platform level upon the completion of the basement.

#### **Earthworks within the build-able area (ie outside the building setback area)**

Earthworks within the build-able area of more than 1m are subject to
evaluation depending on merits. If the earthfill of more than 1m is
allowed, the earthfilled area shall not be counted as an additional
storey provided the overall aggregate building height complies with the
maximum allowable building height measured from the allowable platform
level.

#### **Earthworks within the entire development site**

Earthfill involving the entire development site may only be considered
if the proposed earthworks are required to meet the technical
requirements of PUB. Such earthfill may be allowed up to the Minimum
Platform Level (MPL)^1^ stipulated by PUB.

^1^ **Minimum Platform Level (MPL)**: The minimum 1^st^ storey level to
be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public
Utilities Board (PUB).

**Retaining & Boundary Walls**

![Dimensions and terracing of retaining walls](media/image23.jpeg){width="6.496062992125984in"
height="4.771681977252843in"}

*Allowable Height of Retaining and Boundary Walls*

The maximum allowable height for boundary walls is 1.8m.

High retaining walls shall be avoided wherever possible, particularly
for small in-fill plots. If they have to be built and can be allowed,
they shall meet the following requirements:

-   the height shall be less than 1.5m;

-   retaining walls higher than 1.5m may be considered due to site
    > constraints and the need for extensive excavation;

-   the total visible height of the solid boundary-cum-retaining wall
    > shall not exceed 2.8m, of which the solid boundary wall shall not
    > exceed 1.8m.

If the retaining walls are to meet the MPL requirement stipulated by PUB
for drainage purposes, the retaining walls along the site boundaries
(except along boundaries that abut foreshore, roads, or waterbodies with
drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m wide) need not be tiered as
these are transitory, pending the redevelopment of the neighbouring land
to the same MPL.

The above are general guidelines for earthworks and retaining walls. For
industrial developments, these guidelines will apply differently
depending on the type of development on the neighbouring parcels of
land.

[^1]: Smaller developments of less than 5,000 sqm GFA may be considered
    on a case-by-case basis if agencies determine that sizeable
    productivity and sustainability outcomes relative to the development
    proposal can be achieved based on BE ITM measures proposed by the
    developers.

[^2]: The maximum allowable number of dwelling units for residential
    developments located outside of Central Area is derived from the
    Master Plan permissible intensity, which excludes any bonus GFA the
    site is eligible for.

[^3]: Applications submitted under the Strategic Development Incentive
    (SDI) and Central Business District (CBD) incentive schemes will
    have to comply with stipulated outcomes in the areas of
    digitalisation, productivity and sustainability. The required ITM

    conditions for planning approval for redevelopment proposals via the
    SDI/CBD Incentive scheme. SDI/CBDI proposals will not qualify for
