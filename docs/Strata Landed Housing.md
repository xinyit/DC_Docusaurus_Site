# Strata Landed Housing

**Advisory Notes**

The guidelines set out in this handbook for the various development
control parameters will generally be applied by URA in the consideration
of a development application. However, if the circumstances of a case or
the planning considerations relevant to a case so warrant, URA may in
its discretion decide to depart from these general guidelines. Persons
intending to carry out a development are advised to take this into
consideration in the conduct of their affairs and check with URA through
enquiries or development applications to confirm if their proposals can
be allowed.

The guidelines, principles and illustrations found in the handbook
series are not exhaustive in covering all possible site conditions and
building designs. In evaluating the development applications, URA
reserves the right to evaluate and impose conditions not covered in the
handbook in respond to the specific design of the development proposal
depending on merits.

**Introduction**

![Strata landed housing development](media/image1.jpeg)

*Illustration of a Strata Landed Housing Development*

A strata landed housing comprises strata-titled landed housing units
occupying a common development site with shared communal facilities and
a single vehicular access point.

Any of the following three basic types of landed housing form can be
built as strata landed housing:

-   Strata bungalows (detached houses);

-   Strata semi-detached houses (houses defined by their partial
    > attachment on one side to another unit);

-   Strata terrace houses (houses that are attached along a common
    > boundary party wall and are part of a row of at least three
    > units).

A strata landed development site may have a mix of bungalows,
semi-detached houses and terrace houses occupying a common development
site with shared communal facilities and a single vehicular access
point. The building footprint of each strata landed unit shall have
minimum ground contact of 50sqm. All other requirements are guided by
the envelope control guidelines and respective parameters for the
relevant landed housing type.

Strata landed houses may be allowed within a flats development
site. [Such hybrid developments are not accorded condominium
status]{.ul}. They are not allowed in designated landed housing areas.

The number of strata landed housing units allowable depends on the type
of landed housing forms proposed apart from a minimum communal open
space provision requirement. This is to safeguard amenity for strata
landed housing residents, and maintain compatibility of the strata
landed housing development with surrounding landed housing estates.

**Landed Housing guided by Street Block Plans**

Where there is a street block plan to guide landed housing development,
the planning guidelines and requirements stipulated in the street block
plan shall apply.

Conservation guidelines shall also apply for landed housing gazetted for
conservation, such as in the residential historic districts of Blair
Plain, Cairnhill and Emerald Hill.

**Landed Housing in Other Areas**

Other sites zoned for residential use in the prevailing Master Plan may
be considered for landed housing developments, depending on site context
and conditions. Landed houses outside Designated Landed Housing Areas
and not guided by the street block plans are subject to a 3-storey
height control. The prevailing landed housing planning guidelines and
requirements shall also apply.

### Special and Detailed Control Plans 

Special and Detailed Control Plans (SDCP) provide detailed guidelines
for specific areas. The SDCPs may be viewed [here]{.ul}.

**Special Control Areas**

The following areas may be subject to security screening requirements.
URA will confirm this upon submission of a proposed development.

![https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Commercial/-/media/6E0A2A12211B4747BB877736DE0C539C.ashx?h=100%25&w=100%25](media/image2.jpeg){width="6.496062992125984in"

height="3.3169400699912512in"}

*Special Control Area 2*

Qualified Persons (QPs) should consider the screening requirements in
the early stage of their planning and design to avoid abortive work
subsequently.

Where security screening is deemed necessary, it shall consist of
permanent fixtures that are difficult, if not impossible to remove. The
following screening measures may be considered:

#### **Visual Screening**

Residential units and common areas may be screened where necessary with
blank walls, external concrete/metal fins, or the building may be
re-orientated such that the windows^1^/openings/balconies do not have
direct view towards the protected area.

^1^ **Window**: Raised openings that are at least 0.9m above the floor
slab. They are intended to provide ventilation and lighting, and not for
access. Full height windows and windows that are lower than 0.9m that
can potentially be used as access points will need to be highlighted in
the submission plans for URA's evaluation and approval.

#### **Roof Screening**

The parapet wall at the rooftop shall be at least 3m high and access to
the rooftop from a public area shall be secured by a lockable
door/hatch. The door/hatch may be electronically linked to an alarm
system monitored by the building management.**\
**

**Number of Units**

**Maximum number of strata landed units**

![Allowable intensity for a strata landed development](media/image4.jpeg)

*Dwelling Unit Cap and Maximum GFA*

The cap on the number of allowable units in strata landed housing
developments shall be based on the typical footprint of the conventional
landed housing form used and the development\'s location.

The formulae to compute the maximum number of allowable units in the
various types of strata landed housing developments are shown in the
table below.

The number of units shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
Where necessary, URA may impose stricter controls on the allowable
number of strata landed units for developments in localised areas of
concern (eg severe infrastructural capacity issues), in consultation
with other agencies.

**Gross Floor Area (Individual Units)**

The gross floor area for each individual strata landed housing unit is
the resultant of the building form and envelope.

**Gross Floor Area (Overall Development)**

For developments comprising strata landed housing only, the overall
gross floor area is the resultant of the number of strata landed units
allowed. Refer to section above.

For residential developments with a mix of strata landed housing and
flat units, the overall Gross Floor Area shall be controlled by the
Master Plan Gross Plot Ratio for the site.

**Commercial Quantum**

Commercial uses are not allowed within strata landed housing
developments.

**Site Coverage**

![Illustration of site coverage for strata landed development](media/image5.jpeg)

Of the 45% COS, at least 25% (as a percentage of site area) shall be set
aside for communal on-ground greenery.

Areas classified as COS shall not be included in the boundary of the
individual strata plots. For instance, the 2m planting strips and green
buffers which form part of the minimum 45% COS provision, shall not
contain any Private Enclosed Spaces (PES).

**Semi-Outdoor Spaces**

**Private Enclosed Spaces**

-   The Private Enclosed Spaces (PES) which forms part of the strata
    area shall not be located within the 45% COS, 2m planting strips and
    green buffers.

-   [PES shall be physically demarcated from common areas]{.ul}. Any PES
    fencing that defines the extent of the PES shall not exceed 1m in
    height. This is to ensure the open and semi-outdoor nature of the
    PES is maintained.

-   A 1.8m screen wall may be proposed between PES adjoining each other
    for privacy purposes. Full height separating walls between adjoining
    PES may be allowed if they are to meet FSSD's requirements.

**Private Roof Terrace**

-   For strata landed housing developments near GCBA, Private Roof
    Terraces (PRT) shall be orientated to face away from the Good Class
    Bungalows.

**Vehicular Access and Parking**

**Vehicular Access**

Vehicular access to any strata unit within the development shall be
taken only from the common driveway.

Individual strata units shall not have direct vehicular access from
public roads.

**Car Park Provision**

The overall car park provision for the development shall comply with
LTA's car parking standards.

-   Each strata unit can have up to 2 private car park lots. These shall
    be contiguous with the respective strata unit.

-   These private car park lots may be excluded from gross floor area
    computation. They shall not be subsequently converted to other uses.

### Building Setback from Boundary

![Setback requirements for a strata landed development](media/image6.jpeg)

*Building Setback*

These guidelines are applicable to residential developments comprising
strata landed housing only.

**Road Buffer and Green Buffer**

The building setback controls of strata landed housing developments from
public roads shall be determined by the road buffer as shown in the
table below. Where the strata landed housing development site fronts two
or more public roads, the buffer requirements from the roads shall be
applied to all boundaries fronting roads.

**Road Buffer and Green Buffer requirements**

  ------------------------------------------------------
  **Road Category**   **Road Buffer and Green Buffer**
  ------------------- ----------------------------------
  Category 1          24m\
                      (including 5m green buffer)

  Category 2          12m\
                      (including 5m green buffer)

  Category 3 - 5      7.5m\
                      (including 3m green buffer)
  ------------------------------------------------------

**Common Boundaries Setback and Planting Strip**

Any strata unit within the development site shall be set back 3m
(minimum) from the common site boundary with another development.

A wider setback shall be required for 3-storey strata landed housing
sharing a common boundary with

Good Class Bungalow Areas (GCBA).

**Setback of Strata Landed Housing from Common Boundaries**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\*Roof terrace(s), if proposed, shall be orientated to face away from
the GCBA.

**Ancillary Structures**

![Setback for ancillary structures in a strata landed development](media/image7.jpeg)

*Setback Requirements for Ancillary Structures*

Ancillary structures are minor structures erected to support the main
use of the site. The building setback distance and height control for
ancillary structures shown in the table below.

Ancillary structures located within the green buffer and tree-planting
strip may be assessed in accordance with the objective-based guidelines
administered by NParks --
see [here](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/partner-us/development-plan-submission/guidelines-on-greenery-provision-and-tree-conservation-for-developments).

Ancillary structures located within the physical buffer and building
setback that exceed the requirements in the table above, but are below
6m in height, shall be evaluated depending on the merits of the design
and function.

**Unit Spacing**

Owners/developers and Qualified Persons are free to decide the suitable
front, side and rear spacing between individual strata landed units
within the site.

**RC Flat Roofs**

RC flat roofs shall remain inaccessible except for maintenance purposes
only^1^. Activating the rooftop for uses such as roof terraces may be
allowed depending on the merits of the proposal. No structures shall be
allowed unless otherwise approved by URA. Where allowed, structures
(including any safety barriers) shall comply with height controls^2^ and
the following guidelines.

^1 ^RC flat roofs that are accessible via ladders for maintenance
purposes only are subject to agencies' requirements for safety barriers
to ensure the safety of maintenance personnel. Safety barriers shall not
exceed 1m in height and may be considered beyond the permissible
building envelope.

^2^ Height controls applicable, include:

-   Absolute technical height constraints^@^ (e.g. Aviation paths
    restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).

-   Conservation guidelines (available at [URA
    SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

-   Urban design height controls (available at [URA
    SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

^@^ The absolute technical height (Based on Singapore Height Datum
\[SHD\]) shall take precedence if it is stricter than any of the other
height controls.

**Solar Panels**

The installation of solar panels on RC flat roofs may be considered if
they meet the following criteria:

a.  Solar panels are installed between 10 to 15 degrees relative to the
    horizontal plane to optimise the performance of solar panels and
    minimise glare to the buildings in the vicinity.

Installation of solar panels and M&E equipment such as inverters for the
solar panel system does not require planning permission except in
locations and contexts described below.

**Planning Permission**

a.  **Areas subject to urban design guidelines and Conservation
    > Areas^1^ shall require planning permission due to their impact on
    > the roofscape. **

> ^1^ For Conservation Areas, installation of solar panels without any
> additional works are treated as localised works for the purpose of
> repair and maintenance and are considered Category 3 works for
> Conserved Buildings. Applications for such Category 3 works can be
> made by owners and contractors. Refer to the Conservation
> Guidelines [here](https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Strata-Landed-Housing/~/link.aspx?_id=6F28BA0B83114572ACA7DC1DFB84DBAC&_z=z) and

height="2.796327646544182in"}

*Envelope Control Guidelines*

From 11 May 2015, landed housing is controlled by the envelope control
guidelines. The guidelines define an allowable building envelope for
each landed housing unit based on the landed housing type, setbacks and
storey height.

-   The building footprint of each strata landed unit shall have minimum
    > ground contact of 50sqm;

-   Each unit shall not exceed the permissible building envelope for its
    > landed housing type^1^;

-   The building envelope is illustrated in the figures below.

For existing strata landed housing approved under previous landed
housing guidelines, new Additions and Alterations works shall comply
with the permissible building envelope in the Envelope Control
guidelines.

Where the existing building already exceeds the permissible building
envelope, the new Additions and Alterations shall not further increase
the building bulk. URA will assess such applications on a case-by-case
basis.

^1^ For more details on the allowable configurations for the
semi-detached and terrace landed housing types, refer to Semi-Detached
Housing and Terrace Housing sections respectively.

**Building Height**

Under the envelope control guidelines, the overall building height for
each strata landed housing unit shall be based on the allowable number
of storeys and the floor-to-floor height in metres. The figures below
show the building envelope and the relationship between storey height
and allowable building height in metres.

-   Strata landed housing shall not exceed the 2 or 3-storey height
    > control, or the prescribed storey height as shown in the
    > designated landed housing plan in the Master Plan, whichever is
    > lower. This is to ensure that the height of the development is
    > sympathetic to the existing neighbourhood character^2^.

-   The allowable building height is measured from the external platform
    > level. If there is an existing level difference within the site,
    > the allowable building envelope height may be taken separately
    > from the two distinct platform levels.

-   Lift overrun and safety barriers at RC flat roofs may be considered
    > up to 1m beyond the allowable building height.

^2^ Other height controls may also be applicable, such as:

-   Absolute technical height constraints^@^ (eg Aviation paths
    > restrictions, military and telecommunications installations).

-   Conservation guidelines (available at [URA
    > SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

-   Urban design height controls (available at [URA
    > SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=STB))

^@^ The absolute technical height ~~in terms of metres AMSL~~ (based on
Singapore Height Datum \[SHD\]) shall take precedence if it is stricter
than any the other height controls.

**Mezzanine Floors**

Mezzanine floors are no longer required to be kept to below 50% of a
typical floor plate, and there are no restrictions on window openings on
the front façade of the mezzanine floors.

Landed houses with mezzanine floors shall be designed within the
permissible building envelope stipulated for the landed housing estate
it is located in (ie maximum 12 m overall height for a designated
two-storey landed housing estate and 15.5 m for a designated
three-storey landed housing estate). The headroom proposed for each
floor shall promote good internal spatial quality for residential
living.

![Guidelines for mezzanine floor](media/image12.jpeg)

*Guidelines for Mezzanine Floor*

**Attics**

An attic is an incidental space that may be allowed within the
permissible two-storey and three-storey envelopes respectively. Where
roof terraces are proposed on attic roofs, they shall be located at
least 3m below the top extent of the permissible building envelope to
ensure future coverings by homeowners remain within the overall building
envelope. Roofs with less than 3m below the top extent of the
permissible building envelope shall be proposed as RC flat roofs that
are non-accessible except for maintenance purposes.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

^3^ **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as
required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of
Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

**Basements in Low-lying Areas**

For sites in low lying landed housing areas, internal areas below the
Minimum Platform Level (MPL)^4^ shall be treated as a basement storey
and shall not count as an additional storey, subject to:

-   Any building structures or internal living areas proposed below the
    > MPL shall be fully sealed with no external openings^5^.

-   Overall allowable height (based on the envelope control guidelines
    > for landed houses) shall be measured from the MPL applicable for
    > the site. The car porch roof shall be kept to maximum of 4.5m
    > above the external ground level.

Where the MPL requirement is significantly higher than the existing
levels of adjacent sites or roads, and the existing ground levels shall
be retained, any building structures/internal spaces that are below the
MPL but above the existing ground levels shall comply fully with the
main building road buffer and setback requirements. They shall not be
allowed to be built up to the site lot boundary.

^4^ **Minimum Platform Level (MPL)**: The minimum 1^st^ storey level to
be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public
Utilities Board (PUB).

^5^ If external openings are proposed, additional requirements from PUB
shall be complied with, as follows:

-   The internal finished floor level shall be at least 300mm above the
    > adjacent road level; and

-   Only entrance driveways, bin centres, turfed compound area, car
    > porches or any other areas as may be approved by PUB may be
    > permitted below the MPL. Bedrooms and M&E installations shall be
    > located above the MPL.

**Basements on Sloping Sites**

For plots with sloping ground, exposed basement protrusion above
existing ground level may be considered as shown in the figure above as
long as the allowable basement protrusion is kept within the permissible
Envelope Control building height.

![https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Strata-Landed-Housing/-/media/E7A48537D1D942D78672030CDE0EEE71.ashx?h=100%25&w=100%25](media/image14.jpeg){width="6.496062992125984in"
height="3.3421281714785653in"}

*Basement Protrusion for Sloping Sites*

**~~Special Control Areas~~**

~~Subject to the proposed storey height, developments in the following
areas may be subject to security screening requirements. URA will
confirm this upon submission of a proposed development.~~

![Map of Special Control Area 1](media/image2.jpeg)

*~~Special Control Area 1~~*

![Map of Special Control Area 2](media/image3.jpeg)

*~~Special Control Area 2~~*

~~The general guidelines on screening within the special control areas
are illustrated below. Qualified Persons (QPs) are strongly advised to
consider the screening requirements in the early stage of their planning
and design to avoid abortive work subsequently.~~

**Earthworks**

Earthworks are defined as any operations or works in, on, or over land
which result in substantial modification to the existing ground terrain,
land form, or slope. These include excavation, formation of a new slope
or embankment, and cut and fill operations.

Earthworks involving earthcut or earthfill shall be minimised to avoid
excessive changes to the existing terrain. The scale of earthworks
allowed depends on the location and purpose of the proposed earthworks.
All proposed earthworks shall be evaluated to ensure they are sensitive
to the wider site context and its impact to the surrounding
developments.

![https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/LHD08_Earthworks_Allowable_Earth_Cut.jpg?h=100%25&w=100%25&la=en](media/image15.jpeg)

*Allowable Earthworks*

**Earthworks for the entire development site**

Earthworks to raise the existing platform level of the entire
development site are generally not allowed. This is to avoid creating
new retaining walls.

^1^ **Minimum Platform Level (MPL)**: The minimum 1^st^ storey level to
be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public
Utilities Board (PUB).

**Earthworks within the building setback area**

Earthworks are not allowed within the road buffer/building setbacks. Any
proposed earthworks shall be assessed based on site context. Where
allowed, they shall not exceed 1m.

Earthworks of more than 1m to meet PUB minimum platform level (MPL)
shall be assessed on the merits of the proposal. Refer to earthworks in
low-lying areas sub-section.

Earthworks may be considered to:

-   Create a vehicular access of maximum **4m** wide;

-   Match the existing platform levels of the neighbouring sites;

-   Create a workable platform level to mitigate level differences
    within an undulating or sloping site, or between the site and road;

-   Facilitate building of a fully submerged basement. The area within
    the building setback distances shall be reinstated to the original
    platform level upon the completion of the basement.

**Earthworks within the buildable area (ie outside the building setback
areas)**

The proposed earthworks shall be evaluated in relation to the
permissible building envelope under the Envelope Control guidelines.

**Earthworks in low-lying areas**

For low-lying sites that need to meet PUB's Minimum Platform Level
(MPL):

-   Only the building structures or internal living areas and side/rear
    setback areas shall be raised to meet the stipulated MPL.

-   The road buffer area of the development site need not be raised to
    the required MPL. For flood protection purposes, the road buffer
    area has to be 300mm above the adjacent road level, or not lower
    than the existing ground level, whichever is higher.

-   Any common retaining-cum-boundary walls or fences shall be designed
    sensitively, as these may be higher than the existing levels of
    adjacent houses or land parcels.

-   The following condition shall be annotated on plans: *"The
    Developer/Owner is fully aware that he shall raise the
    structures/areas built to lower platform levels, to or above the
    recommended Minimum Platform Level as and when the adjacent
    grounds/roads are raised in future and comply with any other
    conditions deemed necessary by PUB."*

**Retaining and Boundary Walls**

![https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/F14_Retaining_Wall_1m.jpg?h=100%2525&w=100%2525&la=en](media/image16.jpeg)

*Height of Retaining and Boundary Walls*

**Retaining Walls**

Outward facing retaining walls are not encouraged as they tend to mar
the streetscape. If allowed, retaining walls shall:

-   Not be more than 1m high. Retaining walls more than 1m high may be
    considered along the common boundaries and shall be suitably tiered
    and planted with adequate greenery if alternative measures are
    impractical.

-   Be terraced at minimum 300mm apart, and planted to give an adequate
    greenery effect, if fronting a road or street. 

**Boundary Walls**

Boundary walls shall not exceed 1.8m.

The combined height of retaining and boundary wall shall not exceed
2.8m, of which solid wall shall not exceed 1.8m. Where a boundary wall
is proposed on top of the retaining wall, only porous material (eg
fencing) shall be used for the boundary wall.

Full-height wall along the common boundary between 2 semi-detached
houses abutting the car porch/patio area can be allowed. This may also
be considered for terrace houses if site context allows for it (eg where
the car porches are paired and aligned) or if it is to meet FSSD's
requirements.
