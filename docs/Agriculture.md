### **Advisory Notes**

The guidelines set out in this handbook for the various development
control parameters will generally be applied by URA in the consideration
of a development application. However, if the circumstances of a case or
the planning considerations relevant to a case so warrant, URA may in
its discretion decide to depart from these general guidelines. Persons
intending to carry out a development are advised to take this into
consideration in the conduct of their affairs and check with URA through
enquiries or development applications to confirm if their proposals can
be allowed.

The guidelines, principles and illustrations found in the handbook
series are not exhaustive in covering all possible site conditions and
building designs. In evaluating the development applications, URA
reserves the right to evaluate and impose conditions not covered in the
handbook in respond to the specific design of the development proposal
depending on merits.

**Guidelines at a Glance: Agriculture**

The table below is intended to provide an overview of the key guidelines
applicable for the development type. The full details of the guidelines
are stated in the relevant tabs of this handbook.

### **Introduction**

Agriculture uses comprising agrotechnology parks, aquaculture farms,
plant / landscape nurseries, nurseries, hydroponics farms, agriculture
research / experimental stations and farms are generally zoned
"Agriculture" in the Master Plan.

### **Building Setback from Boundary**

![https://intranet.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Agriculture/Agriculture%20Building%20Setback%20Illustration%202.jpg?la=en](media/image1.jpeg)


*Setback Requirements*

All Agriculture developments shall be sufficiently set back from the
road and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road
reserve1 line or boundary line to the external wall of the agriculture
building, excluding land to be vested to the State for road or drainage
or public purpose.

All Agriculture developments fronting a public road shall provide a road
buffer, the width of which depends on the road category. The
classification of the road category may be obtained from LTA's Road
Interpretation Plan (RIP). A green buffer shall be set aside in the road
buffer depending on the width of the road buffer.

The buffer requirements for the Road Categories 1 to 5 are in Table 1
below. The common boundary setback requirements are in Table 2 below.

1 **Road Reserve**: The plot of land to be vested in the State as
required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of
Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.

*Building Height*

**Overall Building Height**

Unless otherwise stated, the overall building height1 of agriculture
developments is subject to compliance with the technical height
controls of the relevant agencies such as Civil Aviation Authority of
Singapore (CAAS) and the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA).
~~These agencies require the building height to be given in m
AMSL (metres above Mean Sea Level).~~

1 ~~Submissions to other agencies may require the building height
based on the Singapore Height Datum (SHD). The SHD may be a positive or
negative value and it may be supplemented with a "|" or "-" sign for
clarity.~~ Building height is based on Singapore Height Datum (SHD).

### **Allowable Uses**

To ensure that the uses proposed in an agriculture development conforms
to the agriculture zoning of the land, only certain types and quantum of
ancillary and non-agriculture uses may be allowed.

The quantum for ancillary office, workers' quarters, production-related
ancillary use (eg R&D, food processing) and other non-commercial
ancillary uses supporting the operations of the agriculture use shall
adhere to the quantum supported by the lessor of the land (eg Singapore
Food Agency, National Parks Board or Singapore Land Authority).

Covered greenhouse / farm spaces shall be computed as GFA. Netting over
plants will not constitute covered areas, and will not be computed as
GFA.

The GFA for retail / F&B use (restaurant, showroom, and shop) shall be
capped at 200 sqm maximum.

The GFA for visitor centre use shall be capped at 200 sqm maximum.

Residential dwelling houses or units for the owner's own dwelling
purpose shall not be allowed in agriculture developments.

### **Ancillary Structures**

Ancillary structures are minor structures erected to support the main
use of the agriculture site and should not be proposed within the
building setback distance. Ancillary structures proposed within the
building setback distance and their height are subject to evaluation.

Ancillary structures located within the green buffer may be assessed in
accordance with NPARKS' guidelines  see [here](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/partner-us/development-plan-submission/guidelines-on-greenery-provision-and-tree-conservation-for-developments).

### **Parking**

LTA prescribes the parking provision standards and requirements for
motor vehicles and bicycles. The requirements are usually based on the
quantum of the gross floor area of the development uses.

Details may be found in [LTA's Code of Practice for Vehicle Parking
Provision in Developments](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/industry-matters/development-and-building-and-construction-and-utility-works/vehicle-parking.html).

### **Earthworks, Retaining Walls, and Boundary Walls**

**Earthworks**

Earthworks are defined as any operations or works in, on, or over land
which result in substantial modification to the existing ground terrain,
land form, or slope. These include excavation, formation of a new slope
or embankment, and cut and fill operations.

Extensive earthworks are discouraged as it may change the existing
terrain. Earthworks may also result in the building of high retaining
walls that mar the streetscape and have adverse impacts on the
surrounding areas. Earthworks on any development site, where necessary,
shall be minimised.

All earthworks (i.e. earth cut or earth fill) will require endorsement
and clearances from the lessor, SLA, SFA, and PUB.

Planning permission is required if earthworks cause the level of any
point in the land to be more than 1.5 metres above the lower of the
following:

i.  the level of that point in the land at the time when the land was
    leased or agreed to be leased by the State or statutory body; or

ii. the level of any point at the abutting edge of abutting land

Earthworks on a smaller scale than the above may qualify for the
agriculture plan lodgment scheme.

The digging of wells and ponds on agriculture land is authorised and do
not require planning permission.

Earthworks are generally not encouraged, except in the following
circumstances:

-   When the proposed earthworks are to match the existing platform
    levels of the neighbouring sites;

-   When the sites are on undulating or sloping terrain, with large
    differences in platform levels within the site, or between the site
    and the road;

#### **Earthworks within the build-able area (ie outside the building setback area)**

Earthworks within the build-able area of more than 1.5m are subject to
evaluation depending on merits.

#### **Earthworks within the entire development site**

Earthfill involving the entire development site may only be considered
if the proposed earthworks are required to meet the technical
requirements of PUB. Such earthfill may be allowed up to the Minimum
Platform Level (MPL)1 stipulated by PUB.

1 **Minimum Platform Level (MPL)**: The minimum 1st storey level to
be provided within the site. The MPL is determined by the Public
Utilities Board (PUB).

**Retaining & Boundary Walls**

![Illustration of a 1.5m high retaining wall](media/image3.jpeg)


*Allowable Height of Retaining and Boundary Walls*

The maximum allowable height for boundary walls is 1.8m.

High retaining walls shall be avoided wherever possible, particularly
for small in-fill plots. If they have to be built and can be allowed,
they shall meet the following requirements:

-   the height shall be less than 1.5m;

-   retaining walls higher than 1.5m may be considered due to site
    > constraints and the need for extensive excavation;

-   the total visible height of the solid boundary-cum-retaining wall
    > shall not exceed 2.8m, of which the solid boundary wall shall not
    > exceed 1.8m.

If the retaining walls are to meet the MPL requirement stipulated by PUB
for drainage purposes, the retaining walls along the site boundaries
(except along boundaries that abut foreshore, roads, or waterbodies with
drainage reserve equal to or more than 17.5m wide) need not be tiered as
these are transitory, pending the redevelopment of the neighbouring land
to the same MPL.

### **Plan Application Process**

**Land Leased or Sold by the State for Agriculture Use**

Development proposals involving single storey structures not exceeding
12m in height shall be authorised, ie there is no need to submit an
application to URA for planning approval. This is provided there is no
retail / F&B (i.e. shop, restaurant, showroom use) or visitor centre
use; and the structures comply with the minimum building setback / road
buffer set out in the planning guidelines for agriculture developments.
The proposed works may start after written consent is obtained from the
lessor.

For development proposals involving structures that exceed 1-storey or
12m in height, and fully comply with planning guidelines for agriculture
development and lodgement criteria, applicants may engage a Qualified
Person (QP) to lodge their plans with URA for a flat fee for instant
approval. The works can proceed immediately.

Proposals that do not satisfy the authorisation or lodgment criteria
will have to submit a development application with the requisite fees to
URA.

1.  The QP appointed to lodge the proposals is required to comply with
    the following procedures under the scheme:

    a.  to submit EDA Form for lodgment to URA before Building Plan
        > submission stage together with a lodgment fee of $1,284 (for
        > the new erection of any building), $909.50 (for additions &
        > alteration works on existing building) or $160.50 (for change
        > of use of premises). All prices are inclusive of 7% GST;

    b.  to ensure that all proposals are endorsed by the lessor for the
        > land (eg SLA, SFA, NParks);

    c.  to ensure all proposals have obtained the written consent from
        > owner/lessee of the land;

    d.  to obtain clearances from all relevant technical departments
        > directly, including BCA, LTA, NParks, FSSD, PUB, DSTA, and
        > NEA;

    e.  to submit all declaration, plans, lessor written endorsement,
        > landowner's consent to URA, that the development works have
        > complied with all development control and other technical
        > requirements; and

    f.  prior to the submission of the application to the Commissioner
        > of Building Control for temporary occupation permit or a
        > certificate of statutory completion under the Building Control
        > Act (Cap. 29), whichever is earlier, for the operations, to
        > submit to URA a declaration that, to the best of the QP's
        > knowledge and belief, the operations are carried out in
        > accordance with the lodged plans and all relevant planning
        > guidelines.

2.  Works declared by the QP in the Lodgment Form which comply with the
    planning and lodgment requirements are deemed to be authorised and
    be allowed to submit for building plan approval. The lodgment
    authorisation letter issued by URA is deemed proof of lodgment.

3.  If any existing structures to be retained and any new works proposed
    cannot fully comply with the prevailing development control
    guidelines and other lodgment requirements, these works will have to
    be submitted as a development application for planning approval.

2 Developments within the Agri-Food Innovation Park (AFIP) are not
eligible. A development application will have to be submitted for all
works within AFIP.

3 For such cases, URA requires planning applications for all proposed
development works to be submitted for approval. Tenants will be guided
to make the planning applications to URA when they seek the landlord's
consent for their development works.

4 Fees for all Outline Applications for New Erection and Additions &
Alterations are 50% of the formal application fee. The fee will not be
allowed to offset the subsequent formal application fee.
