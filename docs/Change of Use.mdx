# Change of Use

## What is the procedure and requirements to operate a service apartment?
You will need to submit a Change of Use request for the property.

# Gross Floor Area
## What does Gross Floor Area (GFA) mean?  
The gross floor area or GFA determines the development intensity of a building. All covered floor areas of a building except otherwise exempted, and uncovered areas for commercial uses are deemed the gross floor area of the building. GFA measures the bulk and intensity of a development for the purposes of plot ratio control and computation of development charge. Using this, the owners or developers are free to determine how much neutral areas they want to provide in their building. 
 
GFA is the total area of the covered floor space measured between the centre line of party walls, including the thickness of external walls but excluding voids. All covered floor area of a building, except otherwise exempted, and uncovered areas for commercial uses are deemed the gross floor area of the building for purposes of plot ratio control and development charge. Mezzanine floor, if any, is treated as a floor and regarded as a storey for planning evaluation purposes. 

# Plot Ratio
## How do you compute plot ratio? 
 
Plot ratio = Gross Floor Area / Site Area  
 
For details, please download the Gross Floor Area handbook: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/gross-floor-area/GFA

# Home Office
## Do I need to inform URA if I do not use my home as a Home Office?  
You do not need to take any action if you no longer want to use your home as a Home Office. The premises will be changed to residential use.  
 
## How long is the Home Office registration valid for? 
The Home Office registration is a one-time registration. The permission for Home Office use is valid for as long as your Home Office remains in operation. Re-registration is not necessary. 
 
You can refer to Home Office for more information : https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Home-Business/Home-Office-Scheme
 
## If I do not conduct business activities within the premises and have no non-resident employees, do I need to register my home as a Home Office? 
You do not need to register for the Home Office Scheme if you use your residential address for business registration purposes only. 
 
You can refer to Home Office for more information: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Home-Business/Home-Office-Scheme
 
## What is a Home-Based Business?  
Home-based business activities are intended for small scale businesses like sewing work and baking at home. 
 
Such businesses are wholly owned and operated by the home owner. The activities should not materially affect the use of the premises as a residential unit and shall not cause disturbance to the neighbours or other residents in the neighbourhood.  
 
You can refer to Home-Based Business for more information: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Home-Business
 
## What is the difference between the Home Office Scheme and the Home-Based Business Guidelines?  
The key difference between the Home Office Scheme and the Small Business Guidelines is that under the Home Office Scheme, you may employ up to two employees who are not residents in the residential premises. Under the Small Business Guidelines, you are not allowed to employ anyone for the home business.  
 
You can refer to Home Business for more detailed information on the two types of uses. 
 
## What is the URA Home Office Scheme?

# Landed Property
 
## How can I find out the allowable building height for landed property?  
You can find the allowable number of storeys for landed residential properties in Singapore in the Landed Housing Area Plans. Landed properties outside the Landed Housing Plans are generally allowed to be built up to three storeys. In addition, the absolute building height (metres) is subject to our envelop control guidelines. 
  
Please note that the allowable building height is expressed in terms of number of storeys for landed housing development. For other types of residential development, the resultant building height in terms of storey is determined by the gross plot ratio prescribed for the site, unless the site is affected by height control plans, envelop control plans, street block plans or other approved special control plans. Some developments may be required to comply with the approved technical height. For more information, please refer to development control handbooks. 
 
To view the maximum permissible plot ratio of a piece of land, you may view the Master Plan via URA SPACE then type the address in the search bar to proceed. The number on the plot represents the maximum permissible plot ratio.

## Can I enclose my balcony?  
Balconies are meant to be semi-outdoor spaces. They cannot be converted into indoor spaces with full-height solid enclosures. For example, enclosing the balconies with fixed or sliding window panes such as 'Smart windows' is not allowed.  
 
Nonetheless, to address concerns on safety and to provide some form of sun shading, we allow balcony screens provided they are fully retractable and allow for natural ventilation at all times, such as in the form of retractable louvered screens. You can also read more about the balcony enclosures guidelines.   
 
## How can I find out the allowable housing form (i.e. whether terrace, semi-detached or detached uses)?  
You can find the allowable housing forms for landed residential properties in Singapore in the Landed Housing Area Plans.  
 
URA will evaluate the building form for landed properties outside the Landed Housing Area Plans individually based on the site's context and surrounding developments. 
 
## How is the allowable plot ratio for landed property determined?  
There is no control on the plot ratio of landed properties. The intensity of landed properties is limited primarily by their storey height. 
 
The plot ratio for landed property is the resultant gross plot ratio after compliance with storey height control for the area and the development control parameters for landed housing such as plot size, road buffer, building setback, floor-to-floor height, site coverage, etc. You can also refer to the interactive visual tool for landed housing. 
 
More information for residential can be found in the Development Control Parameters for Residential Developments handbook.  
 
For non-residential buildings, you can download the Non-Residential handbooks here: https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential

## What do I need to know when renovating a landed residential property?  
First, check whether you require planning permission from URA to renovate your landed residential property. Depending on the nature of renovation, you may need to apply for a planning permission. The types of minor development works exempted from planning permission are the list of exemptions from planning permission.  
 
Then, check if the intended works comply with the development control guidelines such as the required setback of certain building features. You may read up on whether your home improvement works require planning permission and the relevant guidelines. 
 
You can also refer to the interactive visual tool or consult our landed housing chatbot in Landed Housing Area Plans to guide you through your intended renovation works and evaluate on your own if the proposed works comply with the development control guidelines.

## Can I install screening at my balcony?  
As long as the balconies remain semi-outdoor spaces, i.e. are naturally ventilated at all times. The balconies should not be converted into indoor spaces with full-height solid enclosures. For example, enclosing the balconies with fixed or sliding window panes such as 'Smart windows' is not allowed. In addition, any proposed balcony screens should be fully retractable.  
 
Residents can check with their MCST or the developer for the approved balcony screen design for their development. You can also read more about the balcony enclosures guidelines. 
 
## Is planning permission required to construct a cover over my Private Enclosed Space (PES) / Roof Terrace / balcony? 
You will need to apply for planning permission only if the cover over Private Enclosed Space (PES)/ roof terrace/ balcony extends beyond 2 metres from the external wall of the unit. We will evaluate applications for the coverings based on prevailing development control guidelines to ensure that such structures are not excessively large and comply with height controls. The covered spaces are to remain open-sided.  
Whether planning permission is required to construct a cover over your PES / Roof Terrace / balcony depends on the size and location of the cover.

If the cover is open-sided and does not extend beyond 2 meters from the external wall of the unit, you do not need planning permission from URA. However, you will need to seek approval from your Management Corporation Strata Title (MCST) before construction.

If the cover is open-sided but extends beyond 2 meters from the external wall of the unit, or if the cover is enclosed at the sides, you will need to apply for planning permission from URA.

If the cover is enclosed at the sides and has a floor area of more than 10 square meters, you will also need to apply for a building permit from the Building and Construction Authority (BCA).

In all cases, the cover must comply with the URA's development control guidelines. These guidelines specify the maximum size and height of the cover, as well as the setback requirements.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind when constructing a cover over your PES / Roof Terrace / balcony:
The cover must be made of a non-combustible material.
The cover must not obstruct the view of neighboring properties.
The cover must not block the escape routes in case of fire.
 
## My unit has a high ceiling, can I build a loft? 
We can allow a loft that is similar to a furniture deck for resting purposes and exempt it from planning permission if it meets the following criteria: 
•the total area is not more than 5 sqm;  
•it is a lightweight furniture fixture that does not form part of the structural element of the building;  
•there is only one such loft per unit; and  
•the headroom of the loft area is not more than the headroom below the loft.

## What do I need to know when renovating a strata-titled residential property, such as my condominium unit?  
Generally, internal renovation works within your strata unit do not require planning permission. However, renovation works that will result in an increase in Gross Floor Area (GFA) require URA approval. 
 
In particular, if your proposed Additions & Alteration works within the strata unit involve an increase in GFA, you must obtain a letter signed by the Secretary or Chairperson of the council of the Management Committee Strata Title (MCST) confirming that the MCST has obtained 90% resolution and has authorised the carrying out of the proposed works for the strata unit. The signed letter is to be submitted to URA together with the proposal as part of planning application.  
 
## How can I obtain the approved plan for my property?  
A:  You can access planning permissions granted from year 2000 onwards (search by address) at our online development register via URA SPACE. Once you have launched the page, type the address in the search bar. To download the planning decision, select a listed planning decision and then click on "Request for Decision Notice". 
 
If you can't find your required information, you can apply to URA for a search of the approved plans using our e-service 'Buy Planning Records (DC 15)'. 
 
There is a search fee of $107 (including GST). There are also fees if you request for additional plans or printing of documents. 
 
You may also read up on Legal Requisition if you are seeking information on the latest planning decision and the current Master Plan zoning for a property.
